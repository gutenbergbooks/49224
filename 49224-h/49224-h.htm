<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> work of editing these Journals is at an end; it
only remains now for me to thank one of my oldest
and most valued friends, whose assistance in every
way I wish most thoroughly to acknowledge: this is
Mr. Godfrey Thrupp. When it became obvious that
the public demand for the work made its completion
in so short a time impossible&mdash;as the conscientious
achievement of one man&mdash;he generously came forward.
His knowledge of the East and his deep
interest in the subject made him an invaluable
colleague.</p>

<p class="ppq4">“Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br />
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.<br />

<p class="ppn4">Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<br />

<p class="ppn4">And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br />
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue<br />
In every wound of Cæsar, that should move<br />
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.”</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">These</span> grand lines force themselves upon me,
though maybe their analogy is incomplete. Mark
Antony was a casuist, and pleaded the cause of
revenge; I am only earnest in the cause of justice.
Yet I trust in my pleading to enable Englishmen
to realise how great and how sad is the
loss of Charles Gordon, not only to those who
loved him, but to the cause of suffering humanity.
Gordon is dead. We cannot bring him back to life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Yet from his death we may learn at least how fit he
was to teach us while he lived, how fit to hold his
country’s honour in his hand, how fit to judge of
what was right and what was wrong. His journals
are his last words to the world as much as they are
instruction and information to his Government, and
Englishmen who value England’s honour may well
read them with a heavy heart&mdash;with eyes dimmed
by tears. I say Gordon is dead, and we cannot
bring him back to life, but we can do much he
would have done for us <i>had he been allowed to live</i>.
His journals tell us how we can best repair mischief
already done (and I understand his words to apply
rather to the English people than to the Government
which represents them), and they tell us what
is best for the Soudan. In the interest of this unhappy
land he devoted much of his life; in its
interest he died. Let us then compare the opposite
conditions under which the people existed
during Gordon’s presence and absence, and in doing
this let us mark well what Gordon said during his
life, and what his journals say for him now that he
is dead.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>


<p>Gordon used to tell the story of how, when Said
Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt before Ismail, went up to
the Soudan, so discouraged and horrified was he at
the misery of the people, that at Berber he threw his
guns into the river, declaring he would be no party
to such oppression. In this spirit Gordon went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
there as Governor of the Equator in 1874, and
in this spirit he expressed his views on the duties
of foreigners in the service of Oriental States. His
ardent and unstudied words are worthy of the
deepest study. They breathe the kindliest wisdom,
the most prudent philanthropy; and it would be
well if those whose lot is thrown in barbarous lands
would take them for a constant guide. To accept
government, only if by so doing you benefit the
race you rule; to lead, not drive the people to a
higher civilisation; to establish only such reforms
as represent the spontaneous desire of the mass; to
abandon relations with your native land; to resist
other governments, and keep intact the sovereignty
of the State whose bread you eat; to represent the
native when advising Ameer, Sultan or Khedive,
on any question which your own or any foreign
government may wish solved; and in this to have
for prop and guide that which is universally right
throughout the world, that which is best for the
people of the State you serve.</p>

<p>Such were Gordon’s sentiments when he first
entered upon his task; well would it have been for
Egypt, England, and the world, had his successors
taken them to heart and made them their ideal. In
such a case the peace, the happiness he brought to
the Soudan might still have been preserved.</p>

<p>Never perhaps in the histories of barbarous rule
were the ideals of justice and truth more needed
than at this date (1874). Seven-eighths of the population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
were slaves; the country swarmed with slave-hunters
and slave-dealers; and district governors,
greedy for pelf, aided and abetted them in their
raids. So crushed were the remaining population
that they regarded all comers as their foes; so destitute
that they were ready and willing to exchange
their own kin for cattle or for grain. Their flocks
and herds, like their kindred, had been robbed. To
sow they were afraid, for governors and slave-hunters
never let them reap; and if perchance they cultivated
ground, it was a mere patch hidden in some
distant nook out of the enemy’s way. The maxims
of their rulers, prior to Gordon’s advent, had been
that if the natives&mdash;poor unenlightened blacks&mdash;did
not act in the most civilised fashion, then must
they be punished; and when these rulers for their
own acts were brought to book, they cited the native
custom of “plunder no offence” in their own excuse.
How the governors, in league with dealers
and hunters, had acted up to these precepts, was
apparent enough in the desolation which reigned
around, for amid the jungle of stunted trees and tall
grasses not a soul was to be seen&mdash;all driven away
by the slavers in past years. With the Egyptian
Government such was the estimate of this waste,
that it did service as a colony for misdemeanants
among Arab troops; and hundreds of these died
from the damp and the dulness of the scene. In
other parts less than 100 men dared not move from
one station to another, in fear of the retaliating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
tribes, and so far were these stations apart that it
took six weeks to communicate one with the other.
In addition to this certain chieftains who inhabited
the borders of the great lakes were engaged in wars
in which the capture of slaves was the main motive.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, was the state of affairs between
Kartoum and the Lakes when Gordon made his
journey thither; yet it afforded in no way the only
instance of oppression, anarchy or misrule in these
lands. In Kordofan and Darfour the slave-traffic
was even more formidable than here. In the latter
province a war between the slave-dealers and the
Sultan’s troops was just concluded, and the two
vast lands, with Darfertit, had been made into a
Homkumdircat, or Governor-General’s district responsible
to Cairo, and separated from the Soudan.
But Gordon’s work was for the present confined to
laying down a chain of posts between Gondokoro
and the Lakes, and by this and other means contributing
to the welfare of the tribes and the confusion
of the slavers. To gain the confidence of the
natives was his first care; and to this end he ventured
alone and unarmed into those isolated spots,
whither not less than a hundred men had dared to
go. Then he showed the people how they might
sow their grain without fear, supplying them with
enough to live on until their wants were met; he
also taught them the use of money, and gave them
task-work. It was infinitely little, he said, among
such a mass, but it was at any rate something, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
might perhaps enable him to solve the question
whether the negroes would work sufficiently to keep
themselves if life and property were secured. To
give them this protection, he seized all convoys of
slaves, and ivory and cattle coming from the south,
punished the slave-dealers, or converted them into
troops, for they were hard, active fellows, the
remnant of an ancient race; and designing and
despotic governors he despatched to Cairo or
Kartoum. The slaves themselves, until he could
deliver them over to their kinsfolk, he kept, the
cattle and the ivory he confiscated, and with the
proceeds swelled the Government treasury.</p>

<p>It would seem the fate of those who devote their
lives to the cause of humanity to be foiled instead of
aided in their aim. In all his efforts for the good
of these blacks Gordon met with every form of
interference whence he might at least expect support.
Ismail Pasha Yacoub, the Governor-General
of the Soudan, jealous of the new Governor of the
Equator and fearful of exposure from so conscientious
a servant of the State, put every obstacle in
Gordon’s way; and the Khedive himself was not
always mindful of the many difficulties to be encountered.
But Gordon said, to blame the Khedive
for his actions you must blame his people, and
blame their Creator; they act after their kind, and
in the fashion they were made. So that he took
little heed of all this. He was content to let it
be widely known that the motto of his province<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
would henceforth be Hurryat (liberty); and this
meant that no man should interfere with another,
that there should be an end to kidnapping and all
plunder, an end to despotic Pashas; and those who
objected were told that the motto included <i>their</i>
liberty to quit. Moreover, he was of opinion that
those who annexed the province needed as much
civilisation as those they attempted to civilise; and,
whenever it was necessary, in the interests of his
people, he never hesitated to show them that this
was his view.</p>

<p>Still, though he succeeded in giving peace and
happiness to the people, in reforming the cruelties of
Mudirs and Pashas, in settling the disputes of warring
chiefs, and in laying down the chain of posts between
Gondokoro and the Lakes: in making all these
beneficent reforms, his heart was ever burdened
with the thought of how this new and unaccustomed
good would affect the people and their lands when,
as time went on, himself and his influence were
removed, and his successors, who understood his
high intent as little as they understood the people
themselves, ruled in his stead. “I think, what
right have I to coax the natives to be quiet for
them to fall into the hands of rapacious Pashas?
I think sometimes that through my influence I am
seducing the natives into a position where they will
be a prey to my Arab successor. They would never
do for an Arab what they do for me. I make
friends with the tribes right and left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>But, apart from these feelings, he was not satisfied;
his success in his own province had been complete,
but, instead of meeting with co-operation from the
adjoining Soudan, he had encountered nothing but
interference from its then Governor-General, Ismail
Pasha Yacoub, to whose interests it was to let
slavery go on. For this reason, therefore, Gordon,
after three years’ labour, resigned his post as Governor
of the Equator. But the step was taken in a wavering
spirit; and these are among his last words ere he
left: “By retiring I do not aid anything; by staying
I keep my province safe from injustice and cruelty
in some degree. Why should I fear? Is man
stronger than God? Things have come to such a
pass in these Mussulman countries that a crisis must
come about soon.”</p>

<p>These significant words, so terribly confirmed less
then ten years later, were uttered in September
of 1876.</p>

<p>Gordon’s resignation soon led to his reinstatement
on terms more fitted to his views. In the new
position he felt strongly that, great as was the trust
and the almost superhuman work expected of him,
if he did not entirely succeed at least he would not
be hampered. He was not only appointed Governor-General
of the Soudan in Ismail Pasha Yacoub’s
stead; he was given authority such as none had
previously enjoyed&mdash;complete power, civil and military,
with the life or death of his subjects in his
hand; and no man dare enter his dominions without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
special leave. He had stipulated that this supreme
command should be independent of Cairo, for he
knew the Egyptian authorities to be in favour
of the slave-trade. The undefined territory now
his had hitherto been subject to several governments&mdash;Arab,
Egyptian, Turkish. Henceforth
Soudan was to mean the vast territory limited on
the north by Upper Egypt, on the south by the
Lakes, on the east by Abyssinia and the Red Sea,
and on the west extending beyond Kordofan and
the newly acquired sultanate of Darfour&mdash;the whole
roughly estimated at more than 1600 miles in
length, and 700 miles in width. There were to be
three Vakeels or Sub-Governors: one for the
original Soudan, another for Darfour, and a third
for the Red Sea, or Eastern Soudan.</p>

<p>The suppression of slavery, in which he had been
so far successful in his own province, and the improvement
of communications, which he had long
declared to be the one means by which that traffic
could be effectually checked, were the two objects to
which Gordon was to specially direct his aim.</p>

<p>Remembering his recent experiences, he was fully
prepared for the condition of his new subjects. In
his predecessor, Ismail Pasha Yacoub, he had
already recognised the quintessence of Egyptian
cupidity and Turkish misrule&mdash;the main cause of
the people’s ruin. The experiences of the first
months of his administration only served to confirm
his worst fears; whithersoever he looked he saw an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
enlarged picture of native misery and destitution, of
alien cruelty and oppression he had before witnessed.
He saw that the Circassian Pashas, the
Bashi-Bazouks, the Arab soldiery, the slave-hunters,
were by their acts fast goading the people to revolt;
that tribes which without their interference
would have been at peace were now at war; that
towns which under proper rule would have flourished
were starving or besieged; and that the
land, otherwise fertile, was a waste. On every hand
he found caravans of packed slaves hungering and
parching in the sun, far from their homes and far
from their goal, unless that goal were death; deserts
strewn with innumerable bones; armed bands of
slave-hunters, dogged by the vulture-like dealers,
waiting and watching for further prey; and over all
these reigned the miscreant spirit of Zubair, the slave-king,
now ostensibly a prisoner at Cairo for past
deeds, but actually aiding and abetting this cruel war
against man through his son Suleiman, the chief of
his deserted band. To remove Zubair’s influence
was as impossible of achievement as to cut off the
demand for slaves at Cairo, Constantinople, or
Stamboul; but to break up Suleiman and his band
lay within Gordon’s grasp, and, as one of the main
causes of trouble, he made it his foremost aim.
How he did this by the simple power of his presence,
and how Suleiman and his six thousand, after signal
submission, again broke out into open revolt so soon
as Gordon’s presence was required elsewhere, affords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
one of the most striking examples of the personal
influence he had acquired. Alone and himself unarmed
he had temporarily succeeded in disarming
these rebels; but, this failing in permanent use, he
effectually quelled them in battle; then, to show his
people, his Government, and the world how great
a wrong this slavery was, he ordered the summary
execution of the ringleaders. “With the death of
Zubair’s son,” he said, “there is an end of the slave-trade.”
Never had the Government such a chance
of preventing its renewal. He had disbanded the
Bashi-Bazouks, he had dismissed the peculating
Mudirs and Pashas; and when he left the country,
after a three years’ reign, the people blessed him,
and begged him to return.</p>

<p>Had he been allowed to act according to the letter
and the spirit of the Firman he received, it is most
probable that he would never this second time have
resigned; but the overthrow of Ismail at Cairo and
the dissolution of the Dual Control had with other
changes brought new law-makers for the Soudan.
Ismail, though in many respects an imprudent ruler,
had at least the merit of believing in his English
Governor-General, and of supporting him whenever
it lay in his power. Gordon’s lonely ride into the
slavers’ camp at Shaka had fired the ex-Khedive’s
imagination, and it was observed that, whenever the
Court Pashas attempted to criticise Gordon’s methods
of rule, the Khedive referred them to this deed. Moreover,
he openly acknowledged him as his superior,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
and fought his battles as those of one who was above
the murmur of men. Gordon has, indeed, himself
recorded how the Khedive sent him a congratulatory
letter on the suppression of Suleiman, adding that
during the time of his rule the ex-Khedive supported
him through thick and thin against his own Pashas
and his own people; and certain it is that to the
files of petitions sent to him against Gordon he
would never listen. But when Towfik was set up
it was a different affair. Never was he heard to
mention Zubair’s name. As for the slave-trade, it
was equally ignored. Nay, worse than this, the
Cairo Pashas, powerless in Ismail’s time, had now
full sway, and it being in their interests that the
slave-trade should revive, the choice of Gordon’s
successor was settled among themselves. It fell to
Réouf Pasha, a man whom Sir Samuel Baker had
already exposed as a murderer, and whom Gordon
had in 1877 turned out of Harrat for acts of oppression.
The appointment, therefore, meant nothing
more nor less than a declaration in favour of the
slavers; and it was because Gordon feared this
result that he had said six months before, viz., in
April 1879, that “If the liberation of slaves takes
place in 1884, and <i>if the present system of government
goes on, there cannot fail to be a revolt of the
whole country</i>.” And again he says in 1878, “There
is no doubt that if the Government of France and
England pay more attention to the Soudan and see
that justice is done, the disruption of the Soudan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
from Cairo is only a matter of time. This disruption,
moreover, will not end the troubles for the Soudanese,
though their allies in Lower Egypt will
carry on their efforts in Cairo itself.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>How prophetic these words have since proved to
be it is needless to say. In April 1880, just a year
later, Gordon wrote, as he left for India:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I have learned with equal pain and indignation that the Khedive
and his subordinate officers have permitted the resuscitation of the
slave-trade in Darfour and the other provinces of central and
equatorial Africa, and that fresh parties of slave-hunters are forming
at Obeyed in Kordofan, and that every order which I gave
concerning the suppression of this abomination has been cancelled.</p>

<p>The two missionaries&mdash;Wilson and Felkin&mdash;who have lately
come down from Uganda, passed through these districts, and they
tell me that the slave-hunters are all ready to start once more upon
their detestable trade, and that there is a very strong feeling
abroad that all the Europeans, including of course Gessi and the
other officers who acted under me, are about to be turned out of
the country. This report, even if it be untrue, will largely serve
to lower the authority of the European officers, and to render their
work more difficult.</p>

<p>This news is very disheartening, especially when one realises
the immense misery which will ensue to the remains of these poor
tribes of helpless negroes.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The events which followed on these first examples
of a wholesale perversion of Gordon’s methods have
proved over and over again the value of his warning
words; it is worthy of special remark that among
the causes of the great rebellion which ensued, as
interpreted by the English Government in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
history and the insurrection of the False Prophet,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
not the religious fanaticism of the native tribes has
a foremost place, but the venality and oppression of
by Egyptian officials, the unjust manner of collecting
the taxes, and, <i>above all, the suppression of the slave-trade,
which Gordon had repeatedly said must lead
to future troubles, unless accompanied by a proper
system of government</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the condition into which the Soudan drifted
during Gordon’s absence was due to deliberate
neglect of the precautions he had urged. Had the
Egyptian Government watched and warded off the
regeneration of the slavers after Gordon dealt his
final blow in Suleiman’s death; had they set their
face against the oppression and cupidity of their own
officials, the Soudan might still have been at peace,
as Gordon left it in 1879. But the new rulers were
in favour of slavery, in favour of oppression, in
favour of <i>backsheesh</i>; and “a revolt of the whole
country” was their reward.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;&#10045;<br />&#10045;</p>

<p>It is needless to do more than briefly recall the
events preceding those related by Gordon himself in
these Journals. Every one remembers his going, and
the triumph of his journey and reception in the
Soudan; the wide welcome which his first Proclamation
received, and the fortunes of the peace policy
he at first endeavoured to pursue. Every one remembers
how, before he had been in Kartoum a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
week, he issued a further Proclamation, warning the
rebellious against forcing him to severe measures.
The Sheikhs and people were anxious to be loyal;
without Government protection they would be forced,
in self-defence, to join the Mahdi. This Colonel
Stewart had discovered in his journey up the White
Nile. For this reason Zubair was asked for, the only
man of enough prestige to hold the country together.
A Pasha among the Shaggyeh irregulars, a tribe
wavering between loyalty and revolt, and blockaded
at Halfyeh, outside the city,&mdash;to him were open
sources of information closed to the English Governor-General.
Zubair would prove stronger than
the Mahdi, and the Mahdi must be “smashed up;”
otherwise, not only would peace and the evacuation
of Kartoum be impossible, but Egypt itself would be
in danger. This state of affairs and the measures
necessary for a new departure being alike unacceptable
to Her Majesty’s Government, Gordon thereupon
used, as he had every right to do, the resources
to his hand. His predictions as to what would result
if Zubair were not sent up were soon realised. The
rebels gradually gathered round the city, besieged
its outlying suburbs, and cut the communications.
His suffering subjects, unable to hold out, were either
killed or, escaping, went over to the enemy. In
some cases he managed to drive the rebels from the
trenches of Kartoum, and even to relieve the beleagured
villages, and return loaded with ammunition
and stores; in others, his army of defence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
composed largely of Egyptians and Bashi-Bazouks,
encountered miserable defeat. These expeditions
were made in small steamers, armoured with boiler
plates and carrying mountain guns, with wooden
mantlets of his own contriving. On one occasion
the rebels so harassed the city that Gordon resolved
on a sortie; but no sooner had the rebels retired to
a place of safety than five of his own commanders
charged back on their men and aided the rebels,
who suddenly leaped from their hiding-place, driving
the affrighted army back to Kartoum.  In this
treacherous and cowardly affair the loss on both
sides was great; but the disgrace was the besiegers’,
and of it they showed their sense by crying out for
justice on the traitors. Two of them were tried
and found guilty, and were shot by the men they
had outraged. Henceforth the city was exposed to
the attacks of the Mahdi’s troops; the streets, the
Mission House, the Palace were hourly shelled;
citizens died as they passed from end to end; but
the Governor-General, always exposed as in old
days, though daily inspecting the lines or pacing the
Palace roof, escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Meantime the strength of the rebellion grew
with every day; the Mahdi, still at El Obeyed,
had despatched his emissaries in all directions;
around Suakin, Berber, Shendy, Kassala, the rebels
rapidly recruited their ranks. The would-be loyal
fell from sheer collapse; they were unable to help
themselves. All chance of relief was gone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
the rebel leaders re-echoed in jeering tones the
Governor-General’s reiterated words, “The English
are coming.” Then Berber, the main link between
Kartoum and Cairo, cried out for help, but like
those at Tokar and those at Sinkat, it cried out
in vain. To do as he pleased was the answer
sent to its hitherto loyal Governor; and, to save
his people and himself, he joined the Mahdi’s hordes.
In his triumph, the False Prophet despatched
two dervishes to Kartoum, to ask if Gordon
would himself become a follower of the Imam,
the Expected One; but they were told that no terms
could be made while Kartoum held its ground.</p>

<p>All hope of a peace, all hope of aid from his own
Government or country, being at an end, Gordon
forthwith began to provision the town, and to take
such steps as would ensure a safe means of
defence and attack. Money was scarce, so a
paper currency was established, and three of the
wealthier citizens were called upon to advance sums
on the Governor-General’s security. Their arrears
were paid, the poor were succoured, and rations
issued. All possible precautions were taken for the
safety of the people. Mines were contrived, torpedoes
laid, and broken glass and wire entanglements
arranged, and watchers posted everywhere. The
blacks quartered in the poorer district of the town
were made to serve, and all men ordered to bear
arms; the staple food of officers was biscuit, and
dhoora was given the men. Having made all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
arrangements on land, he now turned his attention
to the Nile; and, as in the campaign against the
Taipings, so in this desperate struggle with the
Arabs, he organized out of the wretched materials at
hand a fleet such as the rebels could not withstand.
Thus he avenged defeat, drew in stores and guns,
and held the enemy at bay. So that for eleven
long months, spite of mutiny, cowardice and
treachery within, and the constant attacks from the
enemy without, he held his own; and to spare, out
of the little navy he had built, a steamer for the
conveyance of his comrades, Stewart, Power, Herbin,
and the Greeks. Moreover, when at last the news
of the English Expedition arrived, he was further
able to send down three other boats to Metemma
for their use. It is at this point, when vainly
watching day and night for English help, that the
Journals begin. How his time was passed till
we should come, how he viewed our chances of
success, and how he proposed to act if we at last
did arrive&mdash;this is a story which the Journals tell
themselves.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to show the conditions under
which the people of the Soudan existed during
Gordon’s absence and during his presence. The
contrast is sufficient to enable the world to believe
that if any man were capable of restoring order to
the country, that man was Gordon. But when he
left England for the Soudan as the Envoy of Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
Majesty’s Government, he had no authority to <i>act</i>,
for his mission was only to advise. He was to
report to Her Majesty’s Government on the military
situation in the Soudan, and on the measures which
it might be deemed advisable to take for the security
of the Egyptian garrisons still holding positions in
that country, and for the safety of the European
population in Kartoum; and, further, upon the
manner in which the safety and good administration
of the Egyptian Government of the ports on the sea
coast could best be secured. So far then all <i>action</i>
lay in the hands of the Government to which
Gordon was to make his report: the administrators
were to be Her Majesty’s Ministers and
their representative at Cairo, while Gordon was
to be their informant, and perhaps subsequently
their agent, to carry out such measures as they
might think fit to adopt. With this arrangement
in view, all who knew Gordon’s character and
antecedents felt that the only chance for the
Soudan lay in Her Majesty’s Government first
accepting such suggestions as he might append to
his report, and, second, in their giving him <i>carte
blanche</i> to carry out those suggestions in his own
way. Little heed was paid to the clause which
said, “You will consider yourself authorised and
instructed to perform such other duties as the
Egyptian Government may desire to entrust to you,”
for its possible value seemed upset by the concluding
sentence, “and as may be communicated to you by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Sir E. Baring.” Yet this clause, strangely enough,
enabled Gordon to hold a position over which even
Her Majesty’s Government could have no control,
unless they openly declared the annexation of Egypt
and the Soudan. The Egyptian Government, that
is the Khedive and his ministers, elected again to
appoint Gordon Governor-General of the Soudan;
Gordon elected to accept that appointment; and
Her Majesty’s Government elected to sanction the
acceptance, in an official communication forwarded
to him through their representative, Sir E. Baring.
From this moment Gordon’s position was entirely
altered. Her Majesty’s Government and the
Egyptian Government agreed that his mission
was no longer to be one of mere reporting. He
was to “<i>evacuate the Soudan, and the Egyptian
Government had the fullest confidence in his judgment
and knowledge of the country, and of his comprehension
of the general line of policy to be pursued; and no
effort was to be wanting on the part of the Cairo
authorities, whether English or Egyptian, to afford
him all the co-operation and support in their power</i>.”</p>

<p>When it became an established fact that
General Gordon, Governor-General of the Soudan,
had been sent up to evacuate the garrisons of the
country, it also became an established fact that
the method of conducting that evacuation had
passed out of the hands of Her Majesty’s Government;
and one may also say it had virtually
passed out of the hands of the Egyptian Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
while Gordon held the Firman of the
Khedive. Therefore, as this Firman was never
cancelled from the day of Gordon’s departure
from Cairo to the day of his death at Kartoum,
and as it said, amongst other things, “We do hereby
appoint you Governor-General of the Soudan, and
we trust that you will carry out our good intentions
for the establishment of justice and order, and
that you will assure the peace and prosperity of
the people of Soudan by maintaining the security
of the roads open, &amp;c.,” it is as unfair as it is illogical
to talk about “<i>General Gordon having exceeded
the instructions conveyed to him by Her Majesty’s
Government</i>.” These instructions were neither more
nor less than those conveyed to him by the Khedive
of Egypt, who actually delegated his own power to
his Governor-General. To exceed his instructions
was an impossibility; to fulfil or to disappoint all
the hopes expressed in them was a possibility dependent
solely on the good or bad faith of the
Governments who employed him.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>The fact that Gordon held his commission in Her
Majesty’s service and the Governor-Generalship
of the Soudan at the same time, in no way compromised
him with Her Majesty’s Government in
regard to their wishes as to how this or that should
be done, or as to how this or that should be left
undone: yet he tried earnestly to identify himself
with their wishes as far as in doing so he could keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
faith with the people he was endeavouring to assist,
and with whom he began to compromise himself.
That he was justified in so doing there should be no
shadow of doubt even in the minds of Mr. Gladstone’s
ministry. The wishes of the Khedive were
accepted by Gordon as the wishes of Her Majesty’s
Government, and he had begun to act, <i>i.e.</i> to compromise
himself with the Soudanese and the
beleaguered garrisons before he reached Kartoum.</p>

<p>These are the Khedive’s wishes as expressed in a
letter to Gordon, dated January 26th, 1884:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Excellency</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4">You are aware that the object of your arrival here and of
your mission to the Soudan is to carry into execution the evacuation
of those territories, and to withdraw our troops, civil officials,
and such of the inhabitants, together with their belongings, as
may wish to leave for Egypt. We trust that your Excellency will
adopt the most effective measures for the accomplishment of your
mission in this respect, and that, after completing the evacuation,
you will take the necessary steps for establishing an organised
Government in the different provinces of the Soudan, for the
maintenance of order, and the cessation of all disasters and
incitement to revolt.</p>

<p>We have full confidence in your tried abilities and tact, and are
convinced that you will accomplish your mission according to our
desire.</p></div>

<p class="p1">The Khedive could hardly have written this letter
had he imagined Lord Granville would telegraph
three months later to Gordon, saying that “undertaking
military expeditions was beyond the scope of
the commission he held, and at variance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
pacific policy which was the purpose of his mission
to the Soudan.”</p>

<p>Effective measures for the accomplishment of
General Gordon’s mission included the possibility
and great probability of serious fighting in the
interest of a pacific policy, and it is strange if Lord
Granville were unable to grasp that fact when he
endorsed the Khedive’s Firman.</p>

<p>So far I have advanced only a few of the innumerable
proofs of Gordon’s authority to act as he
thought fit; as to his capabilities and his judgment
it is unnecessary to speak. Of those who subsequently
would not accept his judgment, one, Mr.
Gladstone, said, “It was our duty, whatever we might
feel, to beware of interfering with Gordon’s plans,
and before we adopted any scheme that should bear
that aspect (<i>i.e.</i> the aspect of interference), to ask
whether <i>in his judgment</i> there would or would not
be such an interference.” The other, Sir Charles
Dilke, said, “He is better able to <i>form a judgment</i>
than anybody. He will have, I make no doubt,
every support he can need in the prosecution of his
mission.”</p>

<p>Personally I do not believe that a single Cabinet
Minister doubted Gordon’s authority to act as he
thought fit, nor do I believe a single Cabinet
Minister doubted either his capabilities or his judgment.
It was only when the Government realised
how strong that authority was; how significantly
Gordon proposed to wield it, and how he meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
to call upon his country to support him in what
was right, irrespective of party feeling and of
prejudiced public opinion, that references were made
to “<i>General Gordon’s peculiar views</i>” and to “<i>his
disobedience of orders</i>.” I would let the latter
remark pass as unworthy of further comment, were
it not for the fact that it has become a common
phrase among the working classes in the North of
England, when they are either speaking of or are
spoken to about General Gordon. Now I sincerely
trust and believe that the Journals will be read eagerly
by the working classes; they cannot occupy their
leisure time better than in reading them, and, indeed,
in learning much of them by heart. I would say
then, to these people, <i>Do not believe that General
Gordon was disobedient to his Government.</i> His
Government permitted him to accept the Khedive’s
Firman, appointing him Governor-General of the
Soudan, with full powers, civil and military, and
the Khedive desired him to “evacuate the garrisons
of the country, and to restore order;” and
the way in which this was to be done was left to
the discretion of the man who had to do it. I
would also ask these people to note particularly that
the Khedive did not tell him to evacuate the
garrisons of Kartoum and leave the other garrisons
in the lurch; did not tell him to sacrifice everything
rather than engage in military operations against the
Mahdi; did not tell him to identify his interests with
those of the people and then to get away as best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
he could, and to leave the people to their fate.
Had the Khedive told him to do this, he would
never have accepted the Governor-Generalship of
the Soudan; and, when his own Government suggested
this method as a way out of difficulties, the
substance of his numerous replies was, “Our relative
positions do not justify you in giving me such orders.
I can only accept them as your wishes; and the duty
I owe to myself, as a God-fearing and an honourable
man, prevents me being able to comply with them.”</p>

<p>When Gordon telegraphed to Sir E. Baring,
“You must see that you could not recall me
nor could I possibly obey until the Cairo employés
get out from all the places. I have named men to
different places, thus involving them with the Mahdi;
how could I look the world in the face if I abandoned
them and fled? As a gentleman could you advise
this course?” he really telegraphed a bitter rebuke to
the English Government; and when he added, “It
may have been a mistake to send me up, but, having
been done, I have no option but to see evacuation
through,” he merely pointed out, what the Government
already knew, namely, that the position they
had allowed him to accept was one over which they
had no legal control, unless they announced the
annexation of Egypt. I, therefore, again most
emphatically repeat, that Gordon in no instance
disobeyed his Government, though he frequently
had to tell them how utterly unable he was to
execute their wishes. The Governor-General of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
Soudan had definite orders from the Khedive, whose
servant he was, and these orders could not be
capsized by the English Government, unless the
Khedive were deposed or Egypt were annexed.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this portion of my subject in a
better way than by quoting what the Khedive said
to Baron Malortie, after he had appointed Gordon
Governor-General of the Soudan. Speaking of his
mission, he remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I could not give a better proof of my intention than by
accepting Gordon as Governor-General with full powers to take
whatever steps he may judge best for obtaining the end my
Government and Her Majesty’s Government have in view. I
could not do more than delegate to Gordon my own power and
make him irresponsible arbiter of the situation. Whatever he
does will be well done, whatever arrangements he will make are
accepted in advance, whatever combination he may decide upon
will be binding for us; and in thus placing unlimited trust in the
Pasha’s judgment I have only made one condition: <i>that he should
provide for the safely of the Europeans and the Egyptian civilian
element</i>. He is now the supreme master, and my best wishes accompany
him on a mission of such gravity and importance, for <i>my
heart aches at the thought of the thousands of loyal adherents whom
a false step may doom to destruction</i>. I have no doubt that Gordon
Pasha will do his best to sacrifice as few as possible; and, should
he succeed, with God’s help, in accomplishing the evacuation of
Kartoum and the chief ports in the Eastern Soudan, he will be
entitled to the everlasting gratitude of my people, who at present
tremble that help may come too late. To tell you that he will
succeed is more than I or any mortal could prognosticate, for
there are tremendous odds against him. But let us hope for the
best, and, as far as I and my Government are concerned, he shall
find the most loyal and energetic support.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The points I have already dwelt upon are all-important
for the correct interpretation of what
Gordon says in his Journals. There are now two
other questions, with which I must deal. The first
of these is “To what extent were H.M. Government
morally bound to support Gordon?” The answer is
to be found in the conditions laid down in the
Khedive’s Firman, which H.M. Government endorsed.
Mr. Gladstone admitted as much in the
House of Commons on Feb. 14th, when he said:
“The direct actions and direct functions in which
General Gordon is immediately connected with this
Government are, I think, pretty much absorbed in
the greater duties of the large mission he has undertaken
under the immediate authority of the Egyptian
Government, <i>with the full moral and political responsibility
of the British Government</i>.” Therefore
we owed the same kind of responsibility to Gordon
as it owed to Egypt, moral and political. Gordon
shows in his Journals what brought about our responsibility
to Egypt. First, we were morally to
blame for General Hicks’s defeat, for had we prevented
the Fellaheen conscripts being dragged in
chains from their homes, and sent up to recruit
Hicks’s army, Hicks would not have left Kartoum,
and his troops would not have been annihilated.
Through this disaster we became morally responsible
for the extended influence of the Mahdi, who, previous
to crushing a huge army, had merely defeated
small detachments of troops far inferior to his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
It was the crushing of Hicks’s force which led the
Mahdi to put forth his agents in all parts of the
Soudan, and thus to convert a trumpery local rising
into a wide-spreading rebellion. So much for our
responsibility from a moral point of view. Our
political responsibility began with the order to
abandon the Soudan (which was unnecessary interference
on our part, inasmuch as the Soudan was
practically lost), and was followed up by our
objection to the despatch of Egyptian or Turkish
troops, our sending Gordon, and our operations for
the relief of Tokar and Sinkat. Right through
we forced the hand of the Khedive. Why did we
not go one step further and force him to cancel the
Firman by which he appointed Gordon Governor-General
of the Soudan? Had we done this, Gordon
would have reverted to his original position as
reporter to Her Majesty’s Government, or he could
have endeavoured to leave Kartoum at once, as his
responsibilities towards the people of the Soudan
would have ceased. Until we did this we were as
responsible to him, morally and politically, as we
were to the Egyptian Government. A little decision
here might have spared to us Gordon, Colonel
Stewart, and Mr. Power; might have prevented the
loss of thousands of other lives; might have saved
us millions of money.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>I am only endeavouring to place Gordon’s situation
and action in a fair light, and I cannot do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
without pointing out how greatly England has
been to blame in not accepting a responsibility
for which she made herself liable. This brings
me directly to the second question, which deals
with the reason why Gordon, with the promised
support of Egypt and England, failed not only to
restore order to the Soudan, but even to extricate
the beleaguered garrisons. Volumes have been
already written on this subject, and there are probably
volumes yet to come, particularly those
representing that Journal by Gordon and Colonel
Stewart, which was captured by a treacherous
enemy, and is now supposed to be in the hands of
Mahomet Achmet, the Mahdi. I will content myself
then with an endeavour to supply what I feel is
the substance of the answer to be found, in this
missing Journal, to the question I have raised.
<i>Gordon was constantly thwarted and never supported</i>
is the summary of a whole which I will give
in detail as briefly as I can.</p>

<p>(1) Gordon wished to visit the Mahdi if he
thought fit, but Sir E. Baring gave him a positive
order from Her Majesty’s Government that he was
on no account to do so. Of course, as I have
already shown, Gordon, in his position as Governor-General,
need not have accepted this as an order,
but he was, as he always has been, most anxious
to conform to the wishes or desires expressed
by Her Majesty’s Government, when those wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
affected only a point of judgment, and not a point
of duty or a point of honour.</p>

<p>(2) Gordon proposed to go direct from Kartoum
to the Bahr Gazelle and Equatorial Provinces, but
Her Majesty’s Government refused to sanction his
proceeding beyond Kartoum.</p>

<p>(3) Gordon desired 3000 Turkish troops, in British
pay, to be sent to Suakin, but Her Majesty’s
Government, advised by Sir E. Baring, who disapproved
of the measure, declined to send these
troops.</p>

<p>(4) Gordon, being convinced that some government
was essential for the safety of the Soudan,
suggested the appointment of Zubair as his successor,
and gave the most cogent reasons why it was
absolutely necessary for the accomplishment of his
mission that the appointment should be made. He
reiterated his request over and over again from
February to December. Her Majesty’s Government
would not permit the Khedive to make this
appointment.</p>

<p>(5) Gordon requested that in the interests of
England, Egypt, and the Soudan, he should be
provided with a Firman which recognised a moral
control and suzerainty over the Soudan. This was
peremptorily refused.</p>

<p>(6) Gordon asked for Indian Moslem troops to be
sent to Wady Halfa. They were refused him.</p>

<p>(7) In March Gordon desired 100 British troops to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
be sent to Assouan or to Wady Halfa. In making
known this desire to Her Majesty’s Government,
Sir E. Baring said he would not risk sending so
small a body, and the principal medical officer said
the climate would exercise an injurious effect on the
troops. These troops were not sent.</p>

<p>(8) Gordon, for the sake of everything and everybody
concerned, showed that the Mahdi’s power must
be smashed. Her Majesty’s Government declined
to assist in, or even to countenance, the process.</p>

<p>(9) Gordon, in a series of eleven telegrams, explained
his difficulties, and said that if Her Majesty’s
Government would not send British troops to Wady
Halfa, an adjutant to inspect Dongola, and then
open up the Berber-Suakin route by Indian Moslem
troops, they would probably have to decide between
Zubair or the Mahdi, and he concluded these telegrams
by saying he would do his best to carry out
his instructions, <i>but felt convinced he would be caught
in Kartoum</i>. Sir Evelyn Baring, in his reply to these
telegrams, recommended Gordon <i>to reconsider the
whole question carefully, and then to state in one
telegram what he recommended</i>!</p>

<p>(10) Gordon telegraphed: “<i>The combination
of Zubair and myself is an absolute necessity for
success. To do any good we must be together, and
that without delay;</i>” and he supplemented this
by another telegram, saying: “<i>Believe me, I am
right; and do not delay.</i>” The combination was
not permitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span></p>

<p>(11) Sir Evelyn Baring telegraphed to Lord
Granville that General Gordon <i>had on several occasions</i>
pressed for 200 British troops to be sent to
Wady Halfa, but that he (Baring) did not think
it desirable to comply with the request.</p>

<p>(12) Gordon desired a British diversion at Berber,
but Sir Evelyn Baring replied that there was no
intention to send an English force to Berber.</p>

<p>(13) Gordon, foiled on every point, telegraphed
a graceful adieu to Her Majesty’s Government.
Then came the fall of Berber, upon which Sir
Evelyn Baring at once telegraphed to Lord Granville
that it <i>had now become of the utmost importance
not only to open the road between Suakin and Berber,
but “to come to terms with the tribes between Berber
and Kartoum</i>”; and Lord Granville telegraphed to
Sir E. Baring that “<i>General Gordon had several
times suggested a movement on Wady Halfa, which
might support him by threatening an advance on
Dongola, and, under the present circumstances at
Berber, this might be found advantageous.</i>”!!</p>

<p>After this, may we not well echo Gordon’s
sentiments, “What a farce if it did not deal with
men’s lives”? If Gordon, instead of being <i>thwarted</i>,
had only been <i>not supported</i>, how different might
have been the result of his mission to the Soudan!
Indeed, one may say how different <i>would</i> have
been the result! for Gordon has practically said
this, and he was a competent and a reliable
judge. If England and Egypt had only said, “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
will give you no help at all; do what you can
with the material you have about you, and do not
refer to us until you have succeeded, or until you
have failed,” I confidently believe Gordon would
have at least relieved the beleaguered garrisons
of the Soudan, and would have sent down all who
wished to leave the country. His weakness was
that of trustfulness&mdash;the besetting weakness of an
honourable man: it had stood him in good stead
through his campaigns in China, and through his
previous operations in the Soudan; through terrible
sufferings which had often made him wish for death.
Then he trusted enemies, and they always enabled
him to save life. Now he trusted friends, and they
only enabled him to die.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p class="ppq4 p1">
“The evil that men do lives after them,<br />
The good is oft interred with their bones.”</p>

<p class="p1">Gordon tells us plainly in his Journals how great
is the evil done by the policy of Her Majesty’s
Government, and for how long that evil will live
when the Government is dead. Is it not possible
to avert something of what is about to happen?
Her Majesty’s Government are, I believe, beginning
to realise how thoroughly correct Gordon was in
his views, and how mistaken they were in not following
his advice at the time he gave it. At all
events after he was dead they expressed their
intention of doing much he recommended while he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
lived. They have been always very late: too late
to save Gordon’s life, and too late to save the lives
of many thousands. May they not be yet in time to
prevent some of the evil that must live after them?
I think Gordon tells them in his Journals they may,
and I think he also tells them how. It is impossible
to read carefully what he says without feeling that
he did not expect to live long, and that he had a
distinct presentiment he would die at Kartoum. At
all events there is a strong undercurrent of this
presentiment all through, and it even rises to the
surface every now and then when he appears to be
taking a hopeful and almost a cheerful view of the
situation. At times it carries all before it, as for
example when he emphasises the possibility of the
fall of Kartoum under the nose of the expedition,
and again in the words with which he concludes his
sixth and last volume; but then, on the other hand,
it is often quite out of sight, especially at such times
as he is discussing his position as Governor-General,
and turning over in his mind the expediency
of appointing Lord Wolseley or Sir Evelyn Baring
as his successor. But, whether on the surface or
deep down, I think it is always there, and I feel
sure that some of his numerous efforts at a solution
of the Soudan problem were intended as final instructions
for Her Majesty’s Government, to be read
after his death or after the fall of Kartoum. The days
of prophecy are gone, and I do not at all wish to place
Gordon in the light of the ancient orthodox and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
professional seer, but in considering his career one
cannot avoid being struck by the remarkable way in
which the lost gift of prophecy has been replaced by
the power of combining knowledge with judgment.
It would be well if Her Majesty’s Government would
bear this in mind, and lay down a distinct line of
policy and action with regard to the Soudan, which
should be based upon what Gordon recommends.
The recall of the troops from the Soudan may have
been necessary to meet the exigencies of the
moment, or it may not; but it is a pity it did not
precede Lord Wolseley’s letter to Cassim el Mousse
Pasha:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>We mean to destroy the power of Mohammed Achmet at
Kartoum, no matter how long it may take us to do so; you know
Gordon Pasha’s countrymen <i>are not likely to turn back from any
enterprise they have begun until it has been fully accomplished</i>.
When that happy event takes place I hope to be able to establish
you amongst your own people, and that you and all others will
realise that the <i>English nation does not forget those who serve it
faithfully</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p></div>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>General Gordon’s Journals are sufficiently characteristic
to enable those who read them with care to
know their author perfectly. The first volume is
alone a very complete introduction, in which each
succeeding page brings you to a closer intimacy. If
a friendship is not established before reaching the
sixth, then all that is noble and chivalrous in man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
can have no charm. Examples of his rare genius,
his nobility, his honesty and his marvellous energy
are to be found throughout, but, in pointing out
a few characteristics, I will confine myself to the
first volume, as I propose to refer chiefly to
special points of military and political interest in
the others.</p>

<p>In this first volume then we have an interesting
instance of Gordon’s nobility, when he declines
to have anything to do with certain doubtful proposals
made by the apostate Europeans in the
Mahdi’s camp, for he declares “treachery never
succeeds; and it is better to fail with clean hands
than to be mixed up with dubious acts and dubious
men. Maybe it is better to fall with honour than
to gain the victory with dishonour, and in this view
the Ulemas are agreed, for they will have nought
to do with the proposals of treachery.”</p>

<p>The generosity of his feeling towards the enemy
is shown when he says: “I do not call our enemy
rebels, for it is a vexed question whether we are not
rebels, seeing I hold the Firman restoring the Soudan
to its chiefs.” His consideration is apparent in his
regret at not being more considerate; and his
tolerance in the desire to spare even the lives of
traitors.</p>

<p>His views on hypocrisy are humorously expressed
when he is speaking of the Mahdi’s trick
of bringing tears to his eyes by the use of pepper
under his finger-nails, and, as tears are considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
a proof of sincerity, he recommends the recipe to
Cabinet Ministers who wish to justify some job.</p>

<p>His severity is evident in his remarks on diplomatists,
whom he considers most unsatisfactory men
to have anything to do with in their official capacity;
and his irritability peeps out when he says: “Egerton
must have considered I was a complete idiot to
have needed permission to contract with tribes to
escort down the refugees. I hope he will get promoted,
and will not be blamed for overstraining his
instructions.”</p>

<p>His religious earnestness is everywhere apparent,
and he delights in endeavours to interpret Scriptural
passages, especially such as are more or less
paradoxical.</p>

<p>As example of his humility I select the passage
where he says: “If we will be with our Master we
must be like Him, who from His birth to His death
may be said to have been utterly miserable as far as
things in this world are concerned. Yet I kick at
the least obstacle to my will.” His desire to help
every one is to be seen on almost every page, and
his forethought, energy and judgment are also everywhere.
His notions of chivalry do not permit him
to countenance the distribution of honours to men
who only do what he considers to be their duty,
and he does not approve of the Victoria Cross being
given in cases of <i>noblesse oblige</i>.</p>

<p>His determination often prompts him to speak
very plainly: “If you remove me from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
Governor-General, then all responsibility is off me;
but if you keep me as Governor-General then I will,
<i>at the cost of my commission</i> in Her Majesty’s
service, see all refugees out of this country.” His
satire is generally severe, but there is nearly always
a cheerful or a good-natured ring in it. The following
is a fair example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">I am sure I should like that fellow Egerton; there is a big-hearted
jocularity about his communications, and I should think
the cares of life sat easily on him. He wishes to know exactly,
“day, hour, and minute,” that I expect to be in difficulties as to
provisions and ammunition.</p>

<p>Now I really think if Egerton was to turn over the “archives”
(a delicious word) of his office, he would see we had been in difficulties
for provisions for some months. It is as a man on the
bank, having seen his friend in river already bobbed down two or
three times, hails, “I say, old fellow, let us know when we are to
throw you the life-buoy; I know you have bobbed down two or
three times, but it is a pity to throw you the life-buoy until you
really are <i>in extremis</i>, and I want to know <i>exactly</i>, for I am a man
brought up in a school of exactitude, though I did <i>forget</i> (?) to
date my June telegram about <i>that Bedouin escort contract</i>.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">He is a strict disciplinarian, and never hesitates
to rebuke laxness in others. “If Abdel Kader is
at Kassala,”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he says, “what on earth are our people
about not to tell me! for of course I could help him.
We seem to have lost our heads in the Intelligence
Department, though it costs enough money.”</p>

<p>His bluntness and honesty are often combined
with subtle humour, and an excellent notion of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
three may be gathered from the last words in this
volume of the Journals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">As for “<i>evacuation</i>” it is one thing; as for “<i>ratting out</i>” it is
another. I am quite of advice as to No. 1 (as we have not the
decision to keep the country), but I will be no party to No. 2
(this “rat” business), 1st, because it is <i>dishonourable</i>; 2nd, because
it is not <i>possible</i> (which will have more weight); therefore,
if it is going to be No. 2, <i>the troops had better not come beyond
Berber till the question of what will be done is settled</i>.</p></div>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>The interest of the second volume is great from a
military point of view, but its value is somewhat
lessened by the fact that Gordon’s instructions and
suggestions were based on the assumption that the
relieving force would reach him some two months
earlier than it did. During those two months
the conditions around Kartoum materially changed,
and with these altering conditions Gordon had to
reconsider many of the manœuvres he at first suggested.
The political interest chiefly consists in
the strong recommendation that the country should
be given to the Turks, or that Zubair should be
established as Governor-General at Kartoum, and
that the Equator should be given to himself. “I
will (<span class="smcap">d.v.</span>) keep it,” he says, “from Zubair;” that
is to say, he will guard the country against all
slave-hunters. In this volume Gordon declines the
imputation that the Expeditionary Force has come
for him, and shows how, to save our national honour,
it has come to extricate the garrisons of the Soudan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
Of the troubles these garrisons were causing him
we get a fair notion, but his complaints seem to be
only a safety-valve for his humour. He knows the
men about him are treacherous and liars, but he
almost seeks excuse for them when he says: “Man
is essentially a treacherous animal; and although
the Psalmist said in <i>his haste</i> ‘all men are liars,’ I
think he might have said the same at his leisure.”
This volume concludes with a new effort to solve
the Soudan problem by suggesting the Khedive
should replace him at once by appointing Abdel
Kader Governor-General.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>This solution is fully discussed in the opening
of Vol. III. It is not one in which Gordon will
participate, but it may prevent his being antagonistic
to the relieving force. Unless he is deposed
nothing will induce him to leave the Soudan until
he can extricate the garrisons. In removing him
from the Governor-Generalship and in replacing
him by Abdel Kader, the Government would be
utilising a man whom they could mould to their own
shape. Of course this solution was, as Gordon
says, in some degree “a trap,” but it recommended
itself as the only way out of the difficulty, if the
Government decided to abandon the garrisons.</p>

<p>The only creditable solution, Gordon still affirms,
is to be found in handing the country over to the
Turks with a subsidy or a sum down; and he
supplements his argument by a programme showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span>
how by this action Her Majesty’s troops could leave
the Soudan with honour before January 1885. “I
think this would read well in history,” he says. “Her
Majesty’s Government, having accepted duties in
Egypt, and consequently in the Soudan, sent up a
force to restore tranquillity, which having been done,
Her Majesty’s Government handed over the government
of the Soudan to the Sultan.” The necessity
for this solution is the result, in Gordon’s opinion,
of the indecisions of Her Majesty’s Government,
and he enumerates with great care the causes
which have hampered his action and thus required
the despatch of a relieving force. This volume
is perhaps more cheerful in its tone than any of
the others. The presentiment that the expedition
will be too late to prevent disaster is rarely evident,
and the advance of the Mahdi promises to decide,
at all events, the fate of those who are shut up in
Kartoum. “A month will see him defeated or
victorious, as God may will it,” and with this philosophical
consolation Gordon ceases to discuss the
future of the Soudan, and begins an interesting
detailed account of the offensive and defensive
manœuvres which are taking place in and around
Kartoum.</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>In the fourth volume&mdash;the shortest of all&mdash;Gordon
continues his narrative of events, and shows
how numerous and how wearisome are the internal
troubles with which he has to contend at Kartoum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
Treachery is silently at work, while indolence,
selfishness, and dishonesty make those who are not
treacherous almost useless. He is the referee of
every petty dispute, as much as he is chief justice,
administrator, and commander-in-chief. The people
demand his decision on every point, political or
personal, and wish to leave it to him to do or not
to do, irrespective of his knowing anything of the
merits of the case they bring before him. His
counsellers say: “Do what you think right, you will
do better than we;” and his reflection is, “I, poor
devil, do not know where to turn.” Then in sorrow
he exclaims, “Oh, our Government, our Government!
What has it not to answer for? Not to
<i>me</i>, but to these poor people. I declare if I thought
the town wished the Mahdi I would give it up: so
much do I respect free will.” It is doubtless these
internal troubles which lead him to say: “It is of
course on the cards that Kartoum is taken under
the nose of the Expeditionary Force, which will be
just <i>too late</i>.”</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>In Vol. V., which begins on the first day of the
Arab New Year, the arrival of the Mahdi at Omdurman
is reported. The treachery referred to in the
previous volume had led General Gordon to make
numerous arrests&mdash;a necessity he deplored; but these
arrests in all probability saved the fall of Kartoum
on October 21st, for the Mahdi had evidently speculated
on either a rising in the town on that day, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
on the gates being opened to him by some of those
who were then imprisoned. On this day Gordon
also received the news of the treaty concluded between
King John of Abyssinia and Admiral Sir
William Hewitt, and his anger at the injustice of
such a treaty is as apparent as is the bitterness of
his satire: throughout the whole volume, indeed, he
cannot get away from this subject, and, though the
frequent effort to dismiss it in disgust from his
mind is evident, he continually reverts to it. He
considers it discreditable, and does not hesitate to
say so. Moreover, he contends that by the Treaty
of Paris, and also by that of Berlin, the integrity of
the Ottoman Dominion is guaranteed by the Powers,
and that it is therefore a farce to say Egypt ceded
Kassala.</p>

<p>His views on the whole policy of Her Majesty’s
Government are summed up in an imaginary scene
in the House of Lords. “The noble Marquis asked
what the policy of Her Majesty’s Government was?
It was as if he asked the policy of a log floating
down stream&mdash;<i>it was going to sea</i>, as any one with
an ounce of brains could see. Well, that was the
policy of it, only it was a decided policy, and a
straightforward one to drift along and take advantage
of every circumstance. His lordship deprecated
the frequent questioning on subjects which his
lordship had said he knew nothing about, and,
further, did not care to know anything about.”</p>

<p>Fielding, had he been alive, would have envied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
Gordon the completeness of this humorous satire.
The results of the policy, as far as it has gone, he
shows to have been the loss of some 80,000 lives and
the effectual restoration of the slave-trade and of slave-hunting:
“a miserable end to diplomacy when it
would have been so easy in 1880 to have settled the
Soudan with decency and quiet, giving up Kordofan,
Darfur, the Bahr Gazelle, and the Equator.”</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>In the latter part of Vol. V., but especially in the
early part of Vol. VI., Gordon fully realises the
<i>Abbas</i> catastrophe. He knows Stewart and Power
are dead. There is no expression of personal
regret, though he is “sorry for their friends.” He
loved them both, and he pays the highest tribute he
can to their merits; but he is sure that in their
present they are happier than in their past. Moreover,
he had done his best, for every precaution
human foresight could conceive he had taken;
having done this, the rest was in the hands of God,
and the disaster was “ordained.” But these views
do not prevent him from courting all inquiry; and
he even holds a court-martial on himself. His
verdict is, that if the <i>Abbas</i> was attacked and overpowered,
<i>he is to blame</i>; but that if she was
captured by treachery, or if she struck a rock, <i>he is
not to blame</i>. In the one case he should have foreseen
the chance, and prevented her going; in the
others he could foresee nothing. It was out of his
power to avert treachery; and the <i>Abbas</i> drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>
under two feet of water, and was accompanied by
two sailing boats.</p>

<p>He explains with care and clearness why Stewart
and Power left him; they went of their free will,
not by his order; for he would not “put them in
any danger in which he was not himself.” If they
went they did him a service, for they could telegraph
his views; if they stayed, they could not help
him. They could go in honour, for they had
promised the people nothing; he could not go in
honour, for he had promised them himself. If
Gordon were alive, and thought any one could misinterpret
what he says, and thus cast a slur on the
memory of either Stewart or Power, he would be
greatly pained. His love and admiration for them
both was evident; and he knew that, had it been
their duty to remain, they would have stayed to die
with him at Kartoum. “If Zubair had been sent in
March, when I asked for him, we would not have
lost Berber, and would never have wanted an expedition;”
and, if Berber had not fallen, Stewart
and Power would have been alive. Zubair had
been his almost first request, and he never ceases
to regret that one who had devoted his life to the
Soudan should not have been allowed to comprehend
its requirements better than those who sat in
Downing Street.</p>

<p>Within a week of beginning this volume of his
Journal, Gordon expected the town of Kartoum to
fall; the recovery of an enormous quantity of stolen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
biscuit enabled him to hold his own for more than
another month. During this time a notion of his
troubles may be gathered from what he says up to
December 14th; his real suffering must for ever
remain unknown. That it depended upon the
suffering of others we may feel assured; he never
knew what it was to feel for himself. He felt for
his country; he felt for all he tried to help, and if
he was among such as were killed first, his dying
thought would have been, “What is to be the future
of all I leave behind?”</p>

<p class="ls2">&#10045;<br />&#10045;&#10045;</p>

<p>In his Journals&mdash;his last words&mdash;those familiar
with his character and life will see Charles Gordon
true to himself to the very end. They will see in
him the same ardent passion for justice and for
truth; the same scorn for wrong-doing and deceit;
the same gentle pity for the sufferings of all, and the
same mercy and forgiveness for his foes: and with
all this is combined the perfection of humility, and
the sense of imperfection. There is no impatience,
save with those who wronged his honour and the
poor people for whom he died; there is no unrest,
for he neared that “life of action” for which he had
long yearned; there is no sorrow, no dark doubt,
for Charles Gordon was with his God.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="clv" id="clv">GENERAL GORDON’S POSITION AT
KARTOUM.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">Only a very few words on my part are necessary in laying
these Journals before the public.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day, 1884, General Gordon arrived at
Brussels from the Holy Land, and at once commenced his
arrangements with His Majesty the King of the Belgians
to proceed to the Congo.</p>

<p>After visiting England once or twice, he left this country
for Belgium and the Congo on the morning of the 16th
January.</p>

<p>On the 17th January he was recalled by telegram. He
reached London on the morning of the 18th, and was on
his road to Kartoum upon that evening.</p>

<p>At this time, he felt quite confident of success, his
instructions being that, by restoring the ancient families,
whose territories had been seized by the Egyptian authorities,
to their former power, he would be able to extricate
the Egyptian garrisons and civil <i>employés</i> with their
families, and remove them to Lower Egypt without difficulty.</p>

<p>During the voyage, however, from Brindisi to Port Said
he prepared a Report, or Memorandum, dated 22nd
January, in which, reviewing these instructions, he drew
attention to some of the difficulties and complications
which were likely to arise in carrying out the policy of
Her Majesty’s Government, and asked for their support
and consideration in case of his being unable to fulfil their
expectations with exactness; and Colonel Stewart, in his
separate observations of the same date, pointed out that,
in view of eventualities for which it would be impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
provide, the wisest course was “to rely on the discretion of
General Gordon and his knowledge of the country.”</p>

<p>General Gordon, it will be seen, accepted&mdash;and disclaimed
the right to express any opinion of his own upon
it&mdash;the policy of leaving the Soudan. It appeared to him
then that to reconquer that country and restore it to the
Egyptian Government without securities for a just and
honest administration would be iniquitous; that, on the
other hand, to secure that object would involve an expenditure
of time and money which could not be afforded, and
consequently he then came to the conclusion that the
Soudan might properly be restored to independence, and
left to itself.</p>

<p>It will be seen, however, that he did not, after his return
to the Soudan, remain long of that opinion. His heart
warmed at once to the people whom he had faithfully
governed, and whose affections he found, or at all events
believed, were constant to him.</p>

<p>It is necessary here to explain that General Gordon had
not intended to go to Cairo, but to proceed <i>viâ</i> Suakin and
Berber. On the invitation, however, of Sir Evelyn Baring,
he went to Cairo and accepted at the hands of the Khedive
a firman appointing him Governor-General of the Soudan,
without which he could have exercised no control over the
Egyptian authorities employed in that province.</p>

<p>It was no part of General Gordon’s character to form a
definite opinion from imperfectly known facts, and to
adhere obstinately to that opinion, notwithstanding the
evidence of altered circumstances and new elements.</p>

<p>We need not therefore be surprised to find that, on
arrival at Abu Hamed, on the 8th February, finding the
state of the country to be less disorganised than he had
supposed, and adverting to the confusion which must ensue
if all traces of the Khedive’s Government were suddenly
effaced, he made the suggestion that a sort of suzerainty
should be kept up, and that the chief officers of the Soudan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
should continue to be appointed by the Khedive, a complete
and abrupt separation being thus postponed, although the
control to be retained would be more nominal than real.</p>

<p>This feeling in General Gordon’s mind grew rapidly
stronger as time went on. When he reached Berber he
saw still more clearly the position he was in, and became
impressed with the impossibility of carrying out his mission
with credit, unless he was able to secure to the provinces
of the Soudan some sort of government in the place of
the one it was intended to withdraw.</p>

<p>Accordingly, upon the day of his arrival at Kartoum
(the 18th February), General Gordon, after pointing out
to the Government the difficulties that surrounded him,
inasmuch as the garrisons and <i>employés</i> were to be
removed, when all form of government would disappear,
urged in the strongest terms he could employ that power
should be placed in the hands of a single man, and that
the man to be chosen should be Zubair Pasha.</p>

<p>Now it may be remarked that although Zubair was one
of the most noted slave-hunters that had ever existed, yet his
ability and influence could not be surpassed, while even the
Khedive could not lay claim to any such proud descent&mdash;Zubair
being a direct descendant of the Abbassides.</p>

<p>This recommendation was rejected by the Government
although renewed over and over again in a most persistent
manner by General Gordon, backed up by Sir Evelyn
Baring, who, on the 9th March, says: “I believe that
Zubair Pasha may be made a bulwark against the approach
of the Mahdi. Of course there is a certain risk that he
will constitute a danger to Egypt, but this risk is, I think,
a small one; and it is in any case preferable to incur it
rather than to face the certain disadvantages of withdrawing
without making any provision for the future government
of the country, which would thus be sure to fall under
the power of the Mahdi.”</p>

<p>I must admit that, up to the end of July, I was of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
opinion that if Zubair had been sent up General Gordon’s
life would have been in danger. On the other hand, I am
aware that a Cabinet Minister of high position was, from
the first, in favour of sending Zubair up, and so indeed
was Lord Wolseley.</p>

<p>At the beginning of August, General Gordon, having
again begged that Zubair might be sent to Kartoum, I
used my endeavours to secure the attainment of that
object, but without success. It was now apparent that
General Gordon could not in honour leave until some form
of future government had been determined upon.</p>

<p>Zubair’s appointment having been disallowed, the only
alternative seemed to be the Turks, and the suggestion
was made that they should occupy the Soudan. Anything,
in fact, to secure the country against anarchy and
its reversion to barbarism.</p>

<p>In must be borne in mind General Gordon did not ask
that an expedition should be sent; on the contrary, he
deprecated sending any, unless for the purpose of saving
the garrisons and of establishing some form of government.</p>

<p>The proposed movement of two squadrons of cavalry
from Suakin to Berber is outside the question. It was to
save Berber they were applied for, not for the relief of
Kartoum. General Gordon’s message was, “Send troops
(200) to Berber, or you will lose it!” It is fair to Sir
Evelyn Baring, to add that on the 24th March he said,
“Under present circumstances I think an effort should be
made to help General Gordon from Suakin, if it is at all a
possible operation.”</p>

<p>If General Gordon had known how much in unison Sir
Evelyn Baring’s advice had been with his own, and what
support he had received at Sir Evelyn’s hands, he would
have been eager, had his life been spared, to acknowledge
that co-operation.</p>

<p>Before concluding, I must say a few words with respect
to the severe comments which occur in places throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>
the Diaries, upon the meagre information he received
from the Intelligence Department,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in connection with
which the names of Major Chermside and Major Kitchener
are mentioned. Now, with regard to the former of
these officers, he was at Suakin, and therefore does not
come into the question. With respect, however, to Major
Kitchener, I am persuaded that he did all in his power
to get messengers into Kartoum, for just in the same way
General Gordon fancied he got them out, and yet how few
succeeded in reaching their destination. In the same way
too as General Gordon fancied his messengers had reached,
so did Mr. Egerton fancy his had been successful, for
at the end of July he hinted that General Gordon could
have sent messengers out, in the same way as others had
got in, and yet at that date only one had done so. It is
due to Major Kitchener to say that from the time he went
to Dongola he certainly kept us acquainted with the position
of affairs at Kartoum in a manner most reliable, and
deserving of much credit.</p>

<p>With these prefatory remarks I leave my brother’s
Journals to speak for themselves. He shows, to my mind,
with the utmost clearness the position in which he was
placed, and reiterates over and over again that nothing will
induce him to leave Kartoum until he has secured the safety
of all those who have stood by him. He says, “I will end
these egotistical remarks by saying that no persuasion
will induce me to change my views; and that, as to force,
it is out of the question, for I have the people with me,
at any rate, of the towns which hold out; therefore, if
Her Majesty’s forces are not prepared to relieve the whole
of the garrisons, the General should consider whether it
is worth coming up. In his place, if not so prepared, I
would not do so. I do not dictate; but I say, what every
gentleman in Her Majesty’s army would agree to, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span>
would be mean to leave men, who (though they may not
come up to our ideas as heroes) have stuck to me, though
a Christian dog in their eyes, through great difficulties,
and thus force them to surrender to those who have not
conquered them, and to do that at the bidding of a foreign
Power to save one’s own skin. Why, the black sluts would
stone me if they thought I meditated such action.”</p>

<p>Up to the 14th December General Gordon could have
got away at any time, had he been so inclined; in fact, he
says, “As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any
moment I wished.” After that date we know nothing.
No doubt Omdurman fell at once, and in all probability the
Island of Tuti followed soon after. General Gordon must
then have seen that no relief could reach him, provisions
were rapidly running out, treachery, as he well knew, was
at work, and the end came.</p>

<p>He writes to his sister on the 14th December: “God
rules all; and as God will rule to His glory and our
welfare, His will be done. I am quite happy, and, like
Lawrence, have tried to do my duty.”</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will add in General Gordon’s own words,
“It is, of course, on the cards that Kartoum is taken under
the nose of the Expeditionary Force, which will be just too
late. The Expeditionary Force will perhaps think it necessary
to retake it; but that will be no use, and will cause
loss of life uselessly on both sides. It had far better
quietly return with its tail between its legs; for, once
Kartoum is taken, the sun will have set and the people
will not care much for the satellites. If Kartoum falls,
then go quietly back to Cairo, for you will only lose men
and spend money uselessly in carrying on the campaign.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="clxi" id="clxi">THE MISSION OF
COLONEL SIR CHARLES WILSON,<br />
<span class="little">R.E., K.C.M.G.</span></a></h2>

<p class="p2">Very severe criticisms have been made upon the manner
in which Sir Charles Wilson carried out the duties that had
been entrusted to him, with regard to communicating with
General Gordon at Kartoum.</p>

<p>The charges made against him may be with advantage
restricted to two:&mdash;</p>

<p>First&mdash;The delay in not proceeding to Kartoum at the
latest on the morning of the 22nd; and</p>

<p>Second&mdash;In not having pushed on to Kartoum itself in
order to ascertain General Gordon’s fate beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wilson left England in order to assume the
position of Head of the Intelligence Department, and also
with the tacit understanding that he was to be specially
employed in order to open direct communication with
General Gordon.</p>

<p>Having this special object in view, Sir Charles Wilson
accompanied Sir Herbert Stewart’s force towards the Nile;
and, when that gallant and highly-distinguished officer
was wounded on the 19th January, he found himself in
command.</p>

<p>Now this force, which did not equal a British battalion
upon its war strength, was hampered with a number of
wounded officers and men, some of whom were with it,
while others&mdash;the bulk&mdash;were in a zereba constructed at
some distance in its rear.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wilson, however, advanced to the Nile, where
he bivouacked for the night; and on the morning of the
20th he returned to the zereba, and brought back with him
to Gubat the wounded who had been left behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 21st, General Gordon’s
steamers appeared, and landed their soldiers, who took
part in the operations of that day.</p>

<p>Reports now reached Sir Charles Wilson that, exclusive
of the Arabs in Metemma, large numbers were advancing
from the North and from the South. It therefore became
imperatively necessary for him to secure the safety of those
who were under his orders before he could proceed upon
his mission.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the morning of the 22nd, he made a
reconnaissance towards the North, and, finding no enemy,
he turned his attention to the South.</p>

<p>The whole of the 23rd was occupied in making arrangements
for the proper protection of his force, and he could
not have left before the morning of the 24th.</p>

<p>It may here be observed, in confirmation of the report
of the Arabs advancing from the south, that Sir Charles
Wilson, on his road to Kartoum, saw a body of men at a
place on the left bank of the Nile, about twelve miles
south of Gubat.</p>

<p>It is really beyond the question to consider what General
Gordon’s position at this time was at Kartoum. When
General Gordon sent down his last journal, on the 14th
December, he stated he could not hold out for more than
ten days, and he was in daily expectation that the Fort at
Omdurman would fall; while even then, with that Fort in
his possession, he considered it would be very hazardous
for any steamer to attempt to come up to Kartoum. On the
28th November he says: “I hope the officer in command
will clear Halfeyeh before he pushes on to this, for he may
get a shell from the works at Omdurman (not the Fort) into
one of his steamers. I do not like to risk sending the
<i>Bordeen</i> steamer down to give the warning. If the steamers
do come up, and have not the sense to stop at Halfeyeh, I
shall endeavour to warn them. The danger is at the Ras
or nose, on the junction of the Blue and White Niles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
proper thing to do would be to clear Halfeyeh camp of
the Arabs before coming on here. You could then communicate
with Kartoum by land, and avoid running the
gauntlet of Arab guns in penny steamboats.”</p>

<p>Now if General Gordon so expressed himself on the 28th
November, two months before Sir Charles Wilson got to
Kartoum, and when the fort at Omdurman and the island
of Tuti were both in the General’s hands, what must have
been the state of affairs when both those positions had
fallen and were in the possession of the Arabs?</p>

<p>Returning to Sir Charles Wilson’s progress with his
detachment of only twenty men, when he got to the point
of danger, as pointed out by General Gordon, he found
himself under a cross fire of artillery and musketry from
all points of the compass, including Kartoum itself. Under
such circumstances he had no alternative but to retire,
since, had he continued his journey, he could never have
secured his retreat.</p>

<p>Consequently I cannot but express my feeling that on
neither head of charge does any blame attach to Sir
Charles Wilson.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4"><a name="clxiv" id="clxiv">DESCRIPTION OF THE JOURNAL.</a></h2>

<p class="pch">[Lieut.-Colonel Stewart kept a complete journal of events that
occurred at Kartoum from the 1st March to the 9th September,
upon the night of which day he left.]</p>

<p class="p1">General Gordon, who had assisted in great measure
in the preparation of this Journal, describes it as a perfect
gem.</p>

<p>It was in duplicate, and was captured when Colonel
Stewart was murdered; and, according to Slatin Bey’s
account (who at the time was with the Mahdi), is now in
his (the Mahdi’s) possession.</p>

<p>General Gordon’s Diaries are in six parts.</p>

<p>The First is from the 10th of September to the 23rd of
September, and contains 78 pages.</p>

<p>The Second is from the 23rd of September to the 30th
of September, and contains 41 pages.</p>

<p>The Third is from the 1st to the 12th of October, and
contains 85 pages.</p>

<p>The Fourth is from the 12th to the 20th of October, and
contains 32 pages.</p>

<p>The Fifth is from the 20th of October to the 5th of
November, and contains 93 pages.</p>

<p>The Sixth is from the 5th of November to the 14th of
December, and contains 104 pages.</p>

<p>The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Diaries are
addressed to Lieut.-Colonel Stewart, C.M.G., or the Chief
of the Staff. The Fifth is addressed to the Chief of the
Staff of the Expeditionary Force for the relief of the
garrison, and the Sixth is addressed in the same way.</p>

<p>The First and Second Diaries were sent on the 30th of
September by steamer for Berber <i>viâ</i> Shendy.</p>

<p>The Third was sent by the steamer <i>Towfikia</i> on the
12th of October to Metemma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fourth was sent to Shendy in a steamer on the
21st of October.</p>

<p>The Fifth left in the steamer <i>Bordeen</i> on the 5th of
November for Metemma;</p>

<p>And the Sixth also left in the steamer <i>Bordeen</i> on the
15th of December.</p>

<p>Each Diary has the same remarks&mdash;sometimes repeated
three times, on the outside of the Journal, to the effect that
“it should be pruned down prior to publication.”</p>

<p>The Journals or Diaries were handed over to Sir Charles
Wilson on the 22nd of January, at Metemma, by the
officer commanding General Gordon’s steamers.</p>

<p>The Journals were, in my opinion, properly considered
by the Government as official documents (see letter
accompanying the last Journal), and were handed over
to me with the remark that, “So far as Her Majesty’s
Government had a desire in the matter, it was for the
publication of the whole Diary; but they did not wish to
interfere with my discretion.”</p>

<p>The note at the end of the first Journal evidently implies
that when the Government have done with the Journals,
then Miss Gordon is to have them.</p>

<p>The publication being, therefore, in my hands, I have
arranged with Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. for their
issue in a very nearly entire state, only some six or seven
pages being omitted, which contain, in my opinion, no
matter of public interest; while, with regard to names,
those who are well acquainted with the affairs of Egypt
can fill up the blanks without difficulty.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that strenuous endeavours may be made
in order to obtain Colonel Stewart’s Journal, together with
those of General Gordon from the 15th of December to the
day upon which Kartoum fell, as well as that of the Doctor
promised to the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>The Cairo telegrams alluded to in the Diaries have not
been handed over to me.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>September 10.</i>&mdash;Colonel Stewart, MM. Power and
Herbin, left during the night for Dongola, <i>viâ</i>
Berber.</p>

<p>Spy came in from south front, and one from
Halfeyeh reports Arabs will not attack, but will
continue the blockade.</p>

<p>Sent off two sets of telegrams by a spy, who will
go to Shendy.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the messenger went out to
deliver my answer to the Arabs, in response to
Mahdi’s letter, though he had a white flag, they
fired on him, and tried to capture him. They use
the white flag, and find it respected by us, and that
we let their men go back. They chain any men we
send to them.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how the people of the town, who
have every possible facility to leave the city, cling
to it, and how, indeed, there are hundreds who
flock in, though it is an open secret we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
neither money nor food.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Somehow this makes
me feel confident in the future, for it is seldom that
an impulse such as this acts on each member of a
disintegrated mass without there being some reason
for it, which those who act have no idea of, but
which is a sort of instinct. Truly I do not think
one could inflict a greater punishment on an inhabitant
of Kartoum than to force him to go to the
Arabs.</p>

<p>Halfeyeh reports that Faki Mustapha, who was in
command of the Arabs on the west or left bank of
the White Nile, wishes to join the Government.
He is informed we are glad of it, but wish him to
remain quiet, and to take no active part till he sees
how the scales of the balance go; if we rise, then
he can act, if we fall he is not to compromise himself;
but what we ask him is to send up our spies,
which he can do without risk.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The same advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
was given to the people of Shendy, who wished to
issue out and attack Berber.</p>

<p>The runaways of Tuti<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> wish to come back, which
is allowed.</p>

<p>The “matches” used for the mines are all finished,
and we are obliged to go back to powder hose,
and unite the mines in families of ten.</p>

<p>Rows on rows of wire entanglement are being
placed around the lines. General Gordon’s horse
was captured by the Arabs in the defeat of El
foun; the other staff horse got a cut on the head,
but is now all right.</p>

<p>The Mahdi is still at Rahad.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The answer to his
letter (<i>vide</i> Colonel Stewart’s journal) was sent
open, so that the Arab leaders could read its
contents.</p>

<p>With respect to letters written to the Mahdi and
to the Arab chiefs, commenting on the apostacy of
Europeans, they may, and are, no doubt, hard, but
it is not a small thing for a European, for fear of
death, to deny our faith; it was not so in old times,
and it should not be regarded as if it was taking off
one coat, and putting on another. If the Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
faith is a myth, then let men throw it off, but it is
mean and dishonourable to do so merely to save
one’s life if one believes it is the true faith. What
can be more strong than these words, “He who
denies Me on earth I will deny in heaven.” The
old martyrs regarded men as their enemies, who
tried to prevent them avowing their faith. In the
time of Queens Mary and Elizabeth, what men we
had, and then it was for less than here, for it was
mainly the question of the Mass, while here it is
the question of the denial of our Lord and of his
passion. It is perhaps as well to omit this, if this
journal is published, for no man has a right to
judge another. Politically and morally, however,
it is better for us not to have anything to do
with the apostate Europeans in the Arab camp.
Treachery never succeeds, and, however matters
may end, it is better to fall with clean hands, than
to be mixed up with dubious acts and dubious
men. Maybe it is better for us to fall with
honour, than to gain the victory with dishonour,
and in this view the Ulemas of the town are agreed;
they will have nought to do with the proposals of
treachery.</p>

<p>No doubt the letters to the Arabs will make the
Arab chiefs work on the Europeans with them, to
take an active part against us, by saying to those
Europeans, “You are cast out;” but the Arabs
will never trust them really, so they can do little
against us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a regular gaol delivery to-day, letting
out some fifty, and are sending to the Arabs
about nine prisoners whom it is not advisable to
keep in the town. A donkey quietly grazing
near the north fort, exploded one of the mines
there (an iron alembic which belonged to the time of
Mahomet Ali, and had been used for the reduction
of gold; it held some 10 lbs. of powder); the donkey,
angry and surprised, walked off unhurt! These
alembics are of this shape, braced
by iron straps together. It is extraordinary
that after a good deal
of rain, and three months’ exposure,
the domestic matchbox should have retained
its vitality.</p>

<p>The school here is most interesting, as the
scholars get a certain ration. It is always full, viz.,
two hundred. Each boy has a wooden board, on
which his lesson is written, and on visiting it the
object of each boy is to be called out to read his
lesson, which they do with a swaying motion of
body, and in a sing-song way, like the Jews do at
the wailing place at Jerusalem and in their synagogues,
from which we may infer this was the
ancient way of worship, for the lessons are always
from the Koran. Little black doves with no pretension
to any nose, and not more than two feet
high, push forward to say the first ten letters of the
alphabet, which is all they know.</p>

<p>We have completed the census (<i>vide</i> Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Stewart’s Journal),<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and have 34,000 people in the
town.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>September 11.</i>&mdash;Stewart’s steamers, which had been
delayed at Halfeyeh<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> owing to some machinery
accident, left last night for Berber.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Spy reports
that one of captured steamers at Berber is disabled

<p>When Cuzzi<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> came to the lines yesterday, the
officer Hassan Bey made him walk over on his knees
in order to pass into lines, pointing out to him that
the lines were thickly spread with fearful mines.
Cuzzi asked what one would do when the Nile fell,
and was told that these new mines would be put
down as the river fell. Hassan Bey put Cuzzi into
a hut, and questioned him as to the whereabouts of
the Mahdi. He said first he was at Duem,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
when pressed he agreed the Mahdi was in Kordofan,
and had not moved. He said the Mahdi had not
more than two regiments; that he had lost heavily
in fighting the mountain tribes of Nubia, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
not much ammunition left; that Waled a Goun
had some 200 regulars with him, 10 mountain guns,
and 2 Krupps, but only 5 boxes of mountain gun
ammunition, and 3 boxes of Krupp, and 5 boxes of
Remington. (The Arabs captured at our defeat at
El foun 75,000 rounds, so that will help them.)
Waled a Goun wanted to go to Giraffe, where Abou
Gugliz was defeated, but Abou Gugliz said it would
never do. Cuzzi looked pretty miserable. Outside
the lines were three Arabs and Zarada (a Greek);
they waited for Cuzzi. Soon after Cuzzi had left
for the Arab camp, two dervishes came in with the
Mahdi’s letter (<i>vide</i> Colonel Stewart’s Journal), and
a dervish dress from the Mahdi to me. They were
given the letters I had received for Slatin for
Cairo, and my answer to the Arabs; also the horse
head-stall which Abou Gugliz had lost, at which
they were amused, and went off to the Arab camp.
I sent out my letter in answer to the Mahdi (<i>vide</i>
Colonel Stewart’s Journal) with a slave, upon whom
they fired. <i>Talataween</i> and <i>Bordeen</i> left for Sennaar
this morning to bring down dhoora.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Letter

should mutually remain quiet, &amp;c., &amp;c., with relation
to one another, as we are rendering the country a
desert.”</p>

<p>Jer. xvii. 5. “Cursed (<i>thus saith the Lord</i>) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his
arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord;”
therefore <i>cursed is he of the Lord</i>, who hopes by any
arrangement of forces, or by exterior help, to be
relieved from the position we are in. Jer. xvii. 7.
“Blessed (thus saith the Lord) is he that trusteth
in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is,” therefore
blessed is he “of the Lord” who makes all his
arrangements of forces, without any reliance on such
arrangements, or on any exterior help, but trusts in
the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> How impossible for man alone to accept
these views, for with what heart can he make his
arrangements if he does not trust in their success!
Curious verses, Ezekiel xxix. 10-14,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as to Egypt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
being waste for forty years from the Tower of Syene
(Assouan) to frontier of Ethiopia; it is certainly
the Soudan which is meant, and it is in a fair way of
being a desert.</p>

<p>A Dervish came in with a letter from Abdel
Kader, the Sheikh on the White Nile, which, with
answer, is annexed;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he also brought a letter from
the messengers who brought in the Mahdi’s letter
on 9th September (<i>vide</i> Col. Stewart’s journal).
They said they had not received my answer, which
it will be remembered was sent out by a slave,
whom they fired upon. This man also brought
in a letter from a Greek, Calamatino,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> who begs
to come in and tell me important news for all
Europe. His letter and my answer are annexed.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Cuzzi adds “he is going
to Berber to-day,” so he may meet with Stewart.
They might have gone down together had they
mutually have known of one another’s departure.</p>

<p>A soldier captured at Obeyed came in, and
reports that his comrades would come in <i>en masse</i>
if we would let them come at night. Abou Gugliz
denies that the head-stall I sent to him is his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>I put down our defeat on the Dem or headquarters
of Sheikh el Obeyed to two things&mdash;1.
A lot of Kartoum pedlars went out to loot,
and they broke the square. 2. Mahomet Ali Pasha
captured a lad of twelve or fourteen years of
age, and the little chap spoke out boldly, and said
he believed Mahomet Achmet was the Mahdi,
and that we were dogs. He was shot! Before I
heard of our defeat I heard of this, and I thought
“<span class="smcap">that</span> will not pass unavenged.” There was an
old belief among old Christians that every event
which happens on earth is caused by some action
being taken in heaven; the action in heaven being
the cause of the event on earth, <i>vide</i> Revelations,
when at the opening of seals the trumpet sounds,
&amp;c., &amp;c., all events exercised in heaven are followed
by events on earth. This being the case, how futile
are our efforts to turn things out of their course.
Vials are poured out on earth whence events happen.
To me, it seems little what those events may be,
but that the great object of our lives is how we
bear those events in our individuality. If we trust
in the flesh, thus saith the Lord, we are cursed; if
we trust in Him we are blessed. I cannot think
that there are any promises for answers to prayer
made for temporal things; the promises are to hear
prayer, and to give strength to bear with quiet what
may be the Will of God. A vial is poured on earth;
events happen; one is furious with the British
Government for these events; but if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
logical, we should be furious with the pourer out of
the vial, and that we shrink from being, for He is
the Almighty who pours out the vial.</p>

<p>This afternoon another mine blew up at Tuti;
the victim was another donkey, who, however, did
not get off so well as his colleague of the North
Fort, for he lost his hind quarters, and was killed.&mdash;R.I.P.</p>

<p>We cannot help thinking something has happened
in Europe of a startling nature, and which is known
to the Arabs in an indistinct way, for they evidently
look on the game as theirs, and that without fighting,
of which they show no sign. Abou Gugliz (in
remonstrating with Waled a Goun, who wished to
descend the river) told him “that his forts were
better than any at Cairo, but that the soldiers came
over them, like afreets;”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> so says the Dervish who
came in to-day.</p>

<p>We decided to-night to send out a letter to
Arabs, saying that though we will not admit any
European into the place we will permit an interview,
with any European they may wish to send
to a flag placed in front of lines, with the Greek
Consul and Greek Doctor.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 12.</i>&mdash;It is most dispiriting to be in the
position I am, if it was not good for me, when I
think that, <i>when I left</i>, I could say, “no man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lift his hand or foot in the land of the Soudan”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> without
me (Gen. xli. 44)<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and now we cannot calculate
on our existence over twenty-four hours. The people
are all against us, and what a power they have; they
need not fight, but have merely to refuse to sell us
their grain. The stomach governs the world, and it
was the stomach (a despised organ) which caused
our misery from the beginning. It is wonderful
that the ventral tube of man governs the world, in
small and great things.</p>

<p>One of Seyd Mahomet Osman’s family, come in
from Shendy, reports Osman Digma, as writing
to Berber, reporting the arrival of the English at
Suakin, their purchase of camels, and advance.
The Arab chief of Berber assembled his subordinates
and told them this, also of the advance of
the troops from Debbeh commanded by English
(Wood’s force) and recommended them to collect
their men. The two captured steamers at Berber
are on opposite sides of river.</p>

<p>Sent out letter to the Arabs to-day, saying I
would let the Greek Consul come out and meet
the Greek who had written to me; the Arabs, this
time, did not fire on the flag of truce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Church parade of Arabs on south front, but very
far off.</p>

<p>The man from Shendy reports that all the right
bank of the Nile is quiet. We have sent out an
escort to try and capture Cuzzi, who is on his way
to Berber.</p>

<p>It certainly is a curious exemplification of how
very lightly religions sit on men, and to note the
fearful apostacy of both Mussulmans and Christians,
when their lives or property are menaced. There is
scarcely one great family of the Soudan, families
who can trace their pedigree for five hundred years,
who have not accepted Mahomet Achmet as
Mahdi, to save their property, though they laugh at
the idea afterwards. I am using this argument
with them, in saying, “You ask me to become a
Mussulman to save my life, and you yourself acknowledge
Mahomet Achmet as the Mahdi, to save your
lives; why, if we go on this principle, we will be
adopting every religion whose adherents threaten
our existence, for you know and own, when you are
safe, that Mahomet Achmet is <i>not</i> the Mahdi.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>One of our captured soldiers from Obeyed came
in from Waled a Goun, and four others with a
woman came in from Faki Mustapha (two of the
last were men slaves of the unfortunate Hassan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Pasha Ibrahim, who was executed); they report
food scarce in the Arab camp, and that many are
striving to run away, owing to the way they are
bullied.</p>

<p>Ulemas are writing letters to Arab chiefs, protesting
against their acts, as being contrary to
Muslim religion.</p>

<p>The Greeks and other prisoners in Obeyed, &amp;c.,
complain bitterly of their privations and ill-treatment
by the Arabs, in the letters they sent in here to
other Greeks.</p>

<p>I was awakened this morning by a woman crying
out, “My son has been murdered, and I demand
justice.” Her little <i>only</i> boy had, it appears, been in
one of the Arab water-wheels, which are moved by
oxen, and a man had pushed him off; his skull was
partially fractured, but he had been in hospital for
some days, and we hoped for his recovery, when
inflammation set in, and he died. He was a nice
little bright-eyed, chocolate-coloured child of eight
years old&mdash;the mother is a widow. One is drawn
towards the children of this country, both browns
and blacks&mdash;the former are of a perfect bronze colour.</p>

<p>The browns and blacks bear their wounds without
a murmur; the poor fellaheen soldiers yell
upon the slightest touch to their wounds.</p>

<p>One of the Arab chiefs came to the Shoboloha
defile, and tried to raise the people to occupy the
passage; the people refused, and the Arab chief
went off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a negro soldier in hospital with a cut on
the nose from a sword; the cut has entered the
nostrils, giving him four openings instead of two&mdash;it
is on the bridge of the nose (if a negro nose can be
said to have a bridge), and the man’s cheeks are
untouched.</p>

<p>One man received a wound in the chest; he lived
eleven days, and died. The doctor found a bullet
lodged in the centre of his heart, in wall of ventricle.
The doctor has this heart in spirits. It was a ball
weighing the same as our Martini-Henri bullet.</p>

<p>The negro soldiers are wonderfully clean, while
the fellaheen and Turkish lot are just the reverse;
the former have the gloss of a well-cleaned and
polished boot, such as the little London shoeblack
loves to turn out for a penny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>A Greek came in from the Arabs to-night; I sent
the Greek Consul to see him on the lines, where
he will stop for the night.</p>

<p>I saw the Ulemas<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to-day, and lamented to them
the degeneracy of the <i>Faith</i>, when Christians become
Mussulmans to save their lives, and Mussulmans
become the followers of the False Prophet, to save
their property. They are going to preach against
this, but I fear much that when it is a question
between Allah and their goats, &amp;c., they will be
inclined to look after their goats, as a rule. I am
afraid we are much the same, and would prefer
50,000 men at our backs, than any Scripture promises;
it is only when we are pushed into a corner,
and cannot get the 50,000 men, that we turn to the
promises&mdash;at least, that is so to a great extent
with me. There is no doubt that success makes
men hard on their fellows, while misfortune makes
them soft. (One has only to study the demeanour
of a Cabinet Minister, or a Colonel while in office,
or out of office, to be convinced of this truth.)</p>

<p>I do not believe that fanaticism exists as it used
to do in the world, judging from what I have seen,
in this so-called fanatic land. It is far more a
question of property, and is more like communism
under the flag of religion, which seems to excite and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
to give colour to acts which men would otherwise
condemn.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>I am sure it is unknown to the generality of our
missionaries in Muslim countries, that in the Koran
no imputation of sin is made on our Lord, neither is
it hinted that He had need of pardon, and, further,
no Muslim can deny that the Father of our Lord
was God (<i>vide</i> Chapter III. of Koran, “the Family
of Touran”), and that He was incarnated by a
miracle. Our bishops content themselves with its
being a false religion, but it is a false religion professed
by millions on millions of our fellow creatures.
The Muslims do not say Mahomet was without sin,
the Koran often acknowledges that he erred, but no
Muslim will say “<i>Jesus sinned</i>.” As far as self-sacrifice
of the body, they are far above Roman
Catholics, and consequently above Protestants. It is
positive trouble when one calls one’s servant to be
continually told he is at his prayers, and one cannot
think that this is an excuse, for it can be no pleasure
to be in a constrained position for a considerable
time, unless one had some faith in those prayers.
The God of the Muslims is <i>our</i> God. And they do
not believe that Mahomet exercises any mediatorial
office for them. They believe they will stand and
fall by their own deeds: in fact they are as much
under the law as the Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>During our blockade, we have often discussed the
question of being frightened, which, in the world’s
view, a man should never be. For my part I am
always frightened, and very much so. I fear the
future of all engagements.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It is not the fear of
death, that is past, thank God; but I fear defeat,
and its consequences. I do not believe a bit in the
calm, unmoved man. I think it is only that he does
not show it outwardly. Thence I conclude no commander
of forces ought to live closely in relation
with his subordinates, who watch him like lynxes,
for there is no contagion equal to that of fear. I
have been rendered furious, when, from anxiety, I
could not eat, I would find those at same table were
in like manner affected.</p>

<p>The Greek Consul came back from seeing the
Greek, who brought a letter<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> from Waled a Goun,
asking me to surrender. I answered as per margin,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
saying I did not see it. The Greek’s object was to
get us to surrender. He says: Lupton,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of Bahr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Gazelle has come down to Shaka, with his men to
surrender, and that Emin Bey of the Equator is
said to be also captured. The Greek says, “Cuzzi
left yesterday for Berber. Slatin Bey<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was in Kordofan.
The Mahdi was on his way here.” According
to the Greek Consul, this man came in to get
money for the Greek prisoners, and for little else.
I have left the Greek Consul to do what he likes
with regard to this.</p>

<p>There was an earthquake, lasting some seconds,
at 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to-night; like the other ones, it was from
south to north.</p>

<p>When one thinks of the enormous loss of life
which has taken place in the Soudan since 1880,
and the general upset of all government, one
cannot help feeling vicious against Sir Auckland
Colvin, Sir Edward Malet, and Sir Charles Dilke,
for it is on account of those three men, whose
advice was taken by Her Majesty’s Government,
that all these sorrows are due. They went in for
the bondholders, and treated as chimerical any who
thought differently from them ... by letting Sir
Auckland Colvin and Sir Edward Malet stay in
Egypt when he went there, got let into their
ways. Time has shown the result of their policy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and we shall hear of them no more. In a
minor degree the <i>Times</i> correspondent at Cairo
and Alexandria is a sinner, for he backed them.
We are an honest nation, but our diplomatists are
conies, and not <i>officially</i> honest.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 13.</i>&mdash;Sent out notifications to all the
authorities in Egypt and the Soudan to search
Cuzzi closely, for I think he is an emissary of the
Mahdi; this can be done under pretence of customs.
I am inclined to think that Cuzzi betrayed Berber
to the Arabs, for how else can the different treatment
he received from the Mahdi from all other
Europeans be accounted for?</p>

<p>Five of our soldiers captured at Obeyed came in
to-day; they report the Arabs not strong, and not
meditating immediate action (they brought their
arms with them); they say the Arabs knew of our
expedition to Berber.</p>

<p>The Ulemas sent a letter<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to the Mahdi to-day;
these letters are interesting, for they show the views
of these people.</p>

<p>The steamers are reported to have passed the
Shoboloha defile safely; they ought to be at Berber
to-day.</p>

<p>Note that I do not call our enemy rebels, but
Arabs, for it is a vexed question whether we are
not rebels, seeing I hold the firman restoring
Soudan to its chiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The Greek who came in yesterday told the
Greek doctor here that the superior of the mission
at Obeyed <i>alone</i> has kept his faith; his name is
“Luigi Bonorni;” the other priests and nuns all
have become Muslims (so he says); the nuns have
nominally married Greeks to save themselves from
outrage. He says Cuzzi received two horses, a
wife, a slave, and $60<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> from the Mahdi, with whom
he was on the closest terms of intimacy. He says,
Slatin had 4000 ardebs<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> of dhoora and 1500 cows,
and plenty of ammunition when he surrendered; he
has been given eight horses by the Mahdi (all this
information must be taken with reserve). The
Greeks here made up £38 for their compatriots in
captivity, and the Austrian Consul sent $100 to the
mission at Obeyed.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> I gave the Greek $5, which I
expect was wasted, and I doubt if the Greek will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
not keep all the money he has received. I grudge
the $20 I gave Cuzzi, for I expect he is a vile
traitor. I expect he gave the Mahdi all the
cyphers; fortunately he had not the Foreign Office
cypher, which Stewart has carried off. Had I
known this information about Cuzzi I ought to have
decapitated him, but it is as well I left him to his
fate.</p>

<p>If what the Greek says is true about the apostacy
of all but Don Luigi, what a spectacle! for
certainly these people came to this country with
more faith than those that stay at home; they could
not expect any comforts in it, but much self-denial.
Some of those nuns had as much as £1000 a year,
which they left to come here. Of course the
Greek’s statement is open to much doubt.</p>

<p>Slatin’s name is Abdel Kadi; Cuzzi’s name is
Mahomet Yusuf. Mahdi proposes I should put
myself, on my surrender (?) under Abou Gugliz, who
is a <i>notorious breaker</i> of the Dervish rules. I forgot
in my letter to remark on this. It appears each of
these men have a spiritual adviser with them, who
acts as a spy as well.</p>

<p>Two more of the Obeyed soldiers escaped this
afternoon; they say the Arabs meditate putting a
gun on the Blue Nile above Bourré, and another in
front of south front of lines, with the idea of bombarding
the town.</p>

<p>Psammitichus<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> besieged Azotus or Ashdod for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
twenty-nine years (according to Herodotus). What
a life for the people of Azotus! One is tired enough
of this, and we have only had six months of it.
Azotus or Ashdod is a miserable little village between
Jafa (which, by the way, is called after <i>Japhet</i>,
the son of Noah) and Gaza.</p>

<p>The black soldiers who come in are generally old
acquaintances of mine, <i>i.e.</i> they know me, while
their black pug faces are all alike to me. I like the
Chinese best, then the pug-faced blacks, then the
chocolate Soudan people. I do not like the tallow-faced
fellaheen, though I feel sorry for them.</p>

<p>Ezekiel xxix. and xxx. are interesting, for they
show Egypt to be doomed to be the basest of
kingdoms, the slave of kingdoms, never possessing a
ruler of its own race (Mahomet Ali was a Sandjak<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
of Salonica, and an alien to this land). The judgments
on this land are on account of its cruelties in
respect to the slave trade. Berber (which Colonel
Stewart ought to pass to-night) is 200 miles from
Merowé, where the cataracts cease, thence there is
open water to Dongola, 150 miles distant from
Merowé; he ought there to find the telegraph open,
and so on the 20th of September he ought to be in
communication with Cairo and Europe.</p>

<p>One thing puzzles me is, if it was really determined
to abandon the Soudan to its fate, why the
people of Dongola and of Senheit were not withdrawn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
when the determination was taken; there
could be no possible object for keeping the peoples
in those places. I think if, instead of ‘Minor Tactics’
or books on art of war, we were to make our young
officers study ‘Plutarch’s Lives,’ it would be better;
there we see men (unsupported by any true belief,
pure pagans), making, <i>as a matter of course</i>, their
lives a sacrifice, but in our days it is the highest
merit not to run away. I speak for myself when
I say I have been in dire anxiety, not for my own
skin, but because I hate to be beaten, and I hate to
see my schemes fail; but that I have had to undergo
a tithe of what any nurse has to undergo, who is
attached to a querulous invalid, is absurd, and not
to be weighed together. When I emerge all are
complimentary; when the invalid dies the question
is, what should be given to the nurse for her
services. We profess to be followers of our Lord,
who, from His birth, when He was hunted, till His
death, may be said to have had no sympathy or
kindness shown Him, yet we (and I say myself
especially) cry out if we are placed in any position
of suffering, whereas it is our <i>métier</i>, if we are
Christians, to undergo such suffering. I have led
the officers and officials the lives of dogs while
I have been up here; it is spurs in their flanks
every day; nothing can obliterate this ill-treatment
from my memory. I may say that I have not
given them a moment’s peace; they are conies, but
I ought to have been more considerate. It is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
painful to see men tremble so when they come and
see me, that they cannot hold the match to their
cigarette. Yet I have cut off no heads; I only
killed two Pashas, and I declare, had it not been for
outside influences, those two Pashas would have
been alive now; they were judicially murdered.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Happy, as far as we can see, are those men who
swing in small arcs; unhappy are those who, seeking
the field of adventure, swing from the extremes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of evil and good. The neutral tint is the best for
wear.</p>

<p>What a contradiction is life! I hate Her
Majesty’s Government for their leaving the Soudan
after having caused all its troubles; yet I believe our
Lord rules heaven and earth, so I ought to hate
Him, which I (sincerely) do not.</p>

<p>I hear Hansall, the Austrian Consul, is disposed
to go with <i>his seven female attendants</i> to the Arabs.
I hope he will do so.</p>

<p>Heaps of cattle come in every day, but very
little grain. Seyd Mahomet Osman has sent word
to his people to go to Kartoum for refuge; this is
pleasant for us! but it shows his confidence in our
future, and it is a great honour to me, who (thank
God) am given faith to outspeak “I am a Christian,”
to have obtained such confidence from a man, who
would, in the times of my glory, scarcely look
at me.</p>

<p>One of his (Seyd Mahomet Osman’s) men going
down to Shendy (where his sister, a very plucky
woman lives) was taking down a pair of slippers for
her, and he brought them here; I wrote my name
on the inside of each, and told him to tell the
“Sitt,” or lady, when she put them on, she put her
claw on my head; the man came back the other day,
and said the “Sitt” was delighted with the idea.</p>

<p>What a row the Pope will make about the nuns
marrying the Greeks! It is the union of the Greek
and Latin churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 14.</i>&mdash;Yesterday evening the Arabs
fired four cannon shots towards lines on south front,
but they did not reach the fortifications.</p>

<p>Halfeyeh<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> reports the assembly of the Arabs,
with a view to attacking that place. A party has
gone out to see what truth there is in this report.</p>

<p>Four other men came in from the Arabs to-day;
they had little to say, beyond that the Arabs meant
to maintain a blockade, and not to attack directly.</p>

<p>The Arabs killed four soldiers who tried to
escape, but those who came in say this will not stop
their coming.</p>

<p>A man I sent out to Waled Mocashee, who
fought with Waled a Goun (<i>vide</i> Stewart’s journal),
was caught with my letters by Arabs, and was on
the eve of being hung, when my letter arrived, in
which I remonstrated with the Arabs for ill-treating
my messengers, on which they pardoned him, and
let him go. This man says the Greek, who came
into the lines yesterday, was sent off to Kordofan
on his return to the Arab camp. The Arabs would
have been quite justified in executing the man
above alluded to, for he was a genuine spy; my
remonstrance to them was with respect to their
treatment of <i>direct</i> messengers I sent to them;
there is considerable doubt that even Waled
Mocashee ever did fight with Waled a Goun.</p>

<p>In my letter to Sheikh Abdel Kader, I proposed
to him to come in and see me; the Arab chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
asked him to go, but he would not; it is well known
we have refused to give in.</p>

<p>If it is possible to get rid of the bitter feelings
existing between the two great sections of the
Soudan people,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> it will go a great way to pacify the
country; by degrees this may be done.</p>

<p>Meat has fallen from 10<i>s.</i> per lb. to 2<i>s.</i> per lb.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Towfikia</i>, which went up the Blue
Nile to Giraffe, fell on the Arabs, and drove them
off from collecting grass and wood (one is thankful
for small mercies in these times).</p>

<p>The word “Islam” means the resigning or devoting
oneself entirely to God and His service, <i>i.e.</i>
self-sacrifice: consequently a true Christian is of the
Islam religion, as far as the name goes (this is Sale’s
translation of the word Islam).</p>

<p>It is curious how quick the people forget their
disasters and losses; it is only ten days ago that we
lost in killed nearly one thousand men, yet no one
speaks of it now; it takes about four or six days to
obliterate the bitterness of a disaster.</p>

<p>The old bugbear of the defection of the Shaggyeh
has sprung up again. Saleh Pasha, who is a prisoner
with the Mahdi, has written to his brother to say he
and the Mahdi are coming, and that he is not to
join me. These sort of things, which are taken up
as gospel truth by those around me, are one of the
most disagreeable parts of my position; those who
will one day declare that the Shaggyeh are faithful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
will two days after urge one to take the sharpest
measures of repression against them, which is, to
my mind, just the way to push them into rebellion,
if they had any tendency that way (I mean by rebellion,
joining the Arabs).</p>

<p>Saleh Pasha’s brother came in to-day to see me;
he has heard that his brother is with the Mahdi at
Schatt, a place inland from Duem, on White Nile.
He seems to think this is authentic; if so, we shall
have the Mahdi here ere long; he has been there
nine days.</p>

<p>The news of the near approach of the Mahdi
has not troubled me, for if he fails he is lost, and
there will be no necessity for an expedition to
Kordofan; if he succeeds, he may, by his presence,
prevent any massacre. I have always felt we
were doomed to come face to face ere the matter
was ended.</p>

<p>I toss up in my mind, whether, if the place is
taken, to blow up the palace and all in it, or else to
be taken, and, with God’s help, to maintain the
faith, and if necessary to suffer for it (which is most
probable). The blowing up of the palace is the
simplest, while the other means long and weary
suffering and humiliation of all sorts. I think I
shall elect for the last, not from fear of death, but
because the former has more or less the taint of
suicide, as it can do no good to any one, and is, in
a way, taking things out of God’s hands.</p>

<p>Schatt is twenty miles inland from Duem, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
is one hundred miles from here, on left bank of
White Nile.</p>

<p>The Greek who came in told the Greek Consul
that the Mahdi puts pepper under his nails, and
when he receives visitors then he touches his eyes
and weeps copiously; that he eats a few grains of
dhoora openly, but in the interior of the house he
has fine feeding and drinks alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p>The Greek says the Mahdi has lots of letters
from Cairo,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Stamboul, and India; that his constant
conversation is Kartoum, and his chance of its
capture.</p>

<p>After this pepper business! I think I shall drop
any more trouble in writing him letters, trying to
convince or persuade him to reasonable measures.</p>

<p>The Greek told the Greek Consul that the Mahdi
was perplexed to know what on earth I was doing
up here, as I had no part or lot in the Soudan. I
expect this question is more perplexing for others
than the Madhi (myself included). I must confess
that the pepper business has sickened me; I had
hitherto hoped I had to do with a regular fanatic,
who believed in his mission, but when one comes to
pepper in the finger nails, it is rather humiliating to
have to succumb to him, and somehow I have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
belief that I shall not have to do so. One cannot
help being amused at this pepper business. Those
who come in, for pardon, come in on their knees,
with a halter round their neck. The Mahdi rises,
having scratched his eyes and obtained a copious
flow of tears, and takes off the halter! As the
production of tears is generally considered the proof
of sincerity, I would recommend the Mahdi’s recipe
to Cabinet Ministers, justifying some job. The
nails (so say the Greeks) must be long! to contain
the pepper.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>September 15.</i>&mdash;Another escaped soldier came in
this morning; reports that they are waiting orders
of the Mahdi, and do not mean to attack the lines.
Charity thinketh no evil. She was not in the
Soudan, for I declare, what with the tricks of the
officials here, Charity would have had a bad time
of it.</p>

<p>They say the Mahdi, when he goes out and sees
a woman carrying a jar of water, rushes at her and
begs to be allowed to carry the water. He rushes
up to the Sitt<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> even as I do, only I have not tried
the water-carrying.</p>

<p>It appears that the pepper business is of old date
in the Soudan, and not invented by the Mahdi.</p>

<p>The strength of eastern potentates is the seclusion
they live in; they are sacred. Once they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
known, they are done for, and perhaps the Mahdi
coming here will do for him. As long as he could
put the misdeeds of his subordinates on them, he
was all right, but when the people see that he does
nothing to rectify wrongs, his prestige ought to go.</p>

<p>This afternoon one of Seyd Mahomet Osman’s
family came up from Shendy; he reports the Stewart
expedition having passed Shendy,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> that they
captured a large boat with grain and twenty-four
slaves, which was collecting taxes for the Arabs. He
reports as true the arrival of troops at Dongola;
that the Mudir of Dongola has quieted his province;
that the Arab chief Mahomet el Khair, of Berber,
on hearing troops had come to Dongola, sent round
to collect the Arabs, promising them $20 a month,
half responded to the call, and came to Berber and
asked for their pay. Mahomet el Khair sent them
to a house where he said the money was (the
Government money, the celebrated £60,000 which
was given to me at Cairo!) When they entered
the house, no money was found, and Mahomet el
Khair explained it by saying the devil had caused
it to enter the earth! He then <i>pretended</i> that the
Mahdi had sent for him, and bolted. He seems to
have seen he could not hold out. If he goes to the
Mahdi, and does not account in some better way for
the disappearance of the money, I fear it will go
hard with him, for the Mahdi, although he allows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
certain freedom in miraculous events, is likely to be
chary in allowing such events among his followers,
especially when they affect his pocket.</p>

<p>Another captured soldier escaped and came in.
He says the Arabs begin to notice these diminutions
of their men, and to be very strict. Nearly all the
soldiers knew me personally in Darfour.</p>

<p>As for the £60,000 which has been lost and stolen
by Soudan Arabs, it is only a tithe of what has
been stolen from the Soudan by the Egyptian
Pashas, that effete race, so I do not regret it.</p>

<p>We hope to finish another of those small steamers
in twenty days, like the <i>Abbas</i> (which went down to
Dongola with Stewart), and in another forty days
to complete another one, this will complete the four
steamers bought by Colonel Prout<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in 1878; one of
them, the <i>Mahomet Ali</i>, is in the hands of the
Arabs, having been surrendered by Saleh Bey.</p>

<p>I should not be surprised if Berber surrendered
to Stewart’s expedition. It was a miserable defence
it made, and the people were never very much
inclined for the Mahdi. I cannot help thinking Cuzzi
was at the bottom of its surrender.</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up above Giraffe
to-day, fired on some Arabs and captured a cow.
Four of the captured soldiers of Obeyed escaped
here; they had little to say, beyond that they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
been very miserable, and that the Arabs hoped we
would surrender.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that Berber will surrender to
Stewart’s party; it would be a great feather in his
cap.</p>

<p>The majority of the soldiers who come in bring
their rifles.</p>

<p>Haunting the palace are a lot of splendid hawks.
I often wonder whether they are destined to pick
my eyes, for I fear I was not the best of sons.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>“Enough for the day is the evil thereof,” but I
cannot help feeling appalled at what is to happen;
even if we do manage to extricate Kartoum from
its troubles, we will have to quiet down all the
countries around Sennaar and Kassala, and to withdraw
from the Bahr Gazelle, and Equator (for I do
not believe the Greek’s story about those lands
being evacuated). Then comes the question of
whether the prisoners in Kordofan are to be left to
their fate. If Her Majesty’s Government has
entered the field this is impossible, and if Her
Majesty’s Government prevent Egypt extricating
them, then it is virtually Her Majesty’s Government
who leaves them to their fate. Besides this,
there is the terrible outlay of money (which has to
be met) for current expenses. Also who is to
govern the country. All idea of evacuation <i>en masse</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
must be given up, it is totally impossible, and the
only solution is to let the Turks come in, or else to
leave me here, the very thought of which makes me
shudder, or to send up Zubair Pasha;<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in both cases
a subsidy of £100,000 is needed per annum.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 16.</i>&mdash;The man left in charge of the
Roman Catholic Mission’s garden is furious with
the Austrian Consul for taking those $100 he
sent to the captives at Obeyed. He says that had
he known they had become Muslim he would have
sent them poison. The $100 came from the sale of
produce of the garden. Whether his anger is owing
to his bigotry, or to the having to give up the $100,
is a question. He says he cannot leave, for he is in
charge of the Bishop’s robes. I expect he holds on
to the garden, whose dates alone sold for over $1600.</p>

<p>A woman escaped from the Arabs this morning.</p>

<p>The notes to Sale’s Koran, chapter xix., entitled
“Mary,” are very interesting, as containing the
Muslim view of our Lord’s conception. The sixteenth
chapter of Koran, entitled “the Bee,” is considered
to allow Muslims to apostatise, if forced by violence
to do so (<i>vide</i> Sale’s notes with regard to Moseilama),
though it is more meritorious not to do so. So the
Muslim here are well off in this respect, <i>vis-à-vis</i>,
the Mahdi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Faki Mustapha, who commanded on the left bank
of the White Nile, and who retired into the interior,
was expected to come over to us. He however has
written a letter<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> in abusive terms to Cassim el
Mousse, in which he maintains that Mahomet
Achmet is the Mahdi. Another soldier came in with
two rifles. <i>Towfikia</i> went up the Blue Nile, and
took on board two runaway slaves. Another man
came in with a letter from a man who is a prisoner
with the Arabs, which letter says positively that
22,000 troops are at Dongola, and that the Mudir of
Dongola is at Merowé, and is pushing on his men.</p>

<p>The soldier who brought in <i>two</i> rifles accounts
for it by saying he started with his companion to
come; that his companion got frightened and dreaded
to delay, so they sat down and his companion went
to sleep; so my friend thought it was time to be off,
and that it was as well to take his comrade’s rifle
with him!!</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 17.</i>&mdash;I have the strongest suspicion that
these tales of troops at Dongola and Merowé are
all gas-works, and that if you wanted to find Her
Majesty’s forces you would have to go to Shepheard’s
Hotel at Cairo.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>The reports of the advance which we get from
Seyd Osman are never supported by any written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
evidence from Dongola, and I expect they are
invented. Whether the resurrection of Stewart,
Power, and Herbin will have any effect remains to
be seen, but, ill-natured or not, it is my firm impression
that Her Majesty’s Government will be most
disagreeably surprised by their emerging.</p>

<p>If Stewart gets down, he ought to be in communication
with Europe on the 22nd of September, and
Power’s telegrams ought to be in <i>Times</i> 23rd September.
It makes me laugh to think of the flutter in
the dovecot which will follow. “<i>That beastly Soudan
again!</i>” (Africa has indeed been a “beast” to our
country, as one of Dickens’s characters called it.)</p>

<p>Egerton’s telegram,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> carefully written in cypher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
(and equally carefully without date, but which we
ascribe to June), respecting the contracts to be
entered into with the Bedouin tribes to escort us down
(“and be sure to look after <i>yourself</i>”!) might have
been as well written in Arabic, it would have produced
hilarity with the Mahdi. Two escaped
soldiers came in with little news, they came with
their arms.</p>

<p>A man came in from visiting the Sheikh el Obeyed.
He says that the Arabs lost very few in their attack
on Mahomet Ali Pasha; that they will wait till the
river falls ere they try and close in on Kartoum.</p>

<p>The righteous indignation, expressed on the publication
of that slave circular, which did nothing
more than say “that the treaty of 1877 (declaring
that the slaves would not be <i>allowed to be sold after</i>
1887) would not be put in force,” is rather amusing
to think over (a <i>pact with the devil</i>, as, I dare say,
some called it), when one thinks that the probability
is the whole country will be a nest of slave
hunters and banditti.</p>

<p>They say the Mahdi means to take up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
quarters on the left bank of the Nile, so as to have
his retreat clear to Kordofan in case of accidents.</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up the Blue Nile,
and found the Arabs near Giraffe, with three guns,
which fired five or six rounds at the steamer, but
did no harm.</p>

<p>The pomp of Egerton’s telegram, informing me
“that Her Majesty’s Government would (really!)
pay on delivery so much a head for all refugees
<i>delivered</i> on Egyptian frontier, and would (<i>positively</i>,
it is incredible!) <i>reward</i> tribes with whom I might
contract with, to escort them down.”</p>

<p>It was too generous for one to believe! Egerton’s
chivalrous nature must have got the better of his
diplomatic training when he wrote it! The clerks
in my divan, to whom I disclosed it, are full of exclamations
of wonder at this generosity! Egerton
must consider that I was a complete idiot to have
needed such a permission. I hope he will get promoted,
and will not be blamed for his overstraining
his instructions!</p>

<p>Another soldier escaped with his wife; he says:
The Arabs brought three guns down to cover
their foraging party, and have taken them back,
which is a relief to me.</p>

<p>I own to a great fear that Stewart’s journal will
not be published <i>in extenso</i>, but will be doctored;
if so, it is a great pity, for there are lots of nice
things in it. For really it is my journal as much as
Stewart’s, though he wrote it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>When the escaped soldiers come in, they pay me
a visit, and are given a dollar, made to look at
their black pug faces in the mirrors, which are in
the palace, and asked their opinion of the reflections.
Some stare with wide open eyes, for <i>they have never
seen themselves before</i>. They generally approve of the
reflections, especially the black sluts, who think themselves
“Venuses,” and shove their hands into their
mouths, which is a general sign among blacks of great
modesty, like the casting down of the eyes with us.</p>

<p>Faki Mustapha’s letter<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> caused great commotion
among the Ulemas, for he says, “He will destroy
the Korans, and shut the mosques, and listen only
to the Mahdi.”</p>

<p>There is a tone in Egerton’s telegram<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which
grates on me; it is, <i>to me</i>, as if he said “You have got
into a mess, and although you do not deserve it, I am
willing to stretch a point in your favour, and authorize
you,” &amp;c. And in the previous part (the
author unknown) of the telegram, it is as if I was
enjoying this wretched fighting up here. I declare
it is Egerton and Co., who made the mess, and would
like to hang its fabrication and solution on me, not
that I mind the burthen, if they did not send such
telegrams (the Co. are Malet and Colvin).<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>I must say I do not love Diplomatists as a rule
(and I can fancy the turning up of noses at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
venturing to express an opinion of them), I mean in
their official attire, for, personally, the few I know
are most agreeable (and I specially except Alston,
the chief clerk, and Weller, the hall porter, who
has, of late years, become quite amiable); but taking
them on their rostrums, with their satellites, from
their chiefs down to the smaller fry, no one can
imagine a more unsatisfactory lot of men to have
anything to do with. I have seen &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;, &mdash;&mdash;,
&mdash;&mdash;, at different times, and when one left their
august presences, one marvelled at the policy of
Great Britain being in such hands. Lord Hammond
was a Tartar, and one knew he was to be
respected.</p>

<p>One would not so much mind if they did not
inoculate with their virus those who get employed
by them, but I have found Stokes of the Suez Canal,
Wilson of Anatolia, and many others (I may say
Stewart), all impregnated with their ideas of sun
worship and expediency. I own to having read
with pleasure the ‘Queen’s Messenger’ till Lord
Carrington stopped its publication, and Marvin’s
work on Public Offices.</p>

<p>A man has come in who says Stewart and his
steamers have captured a large convoy of two
hundred camel-loads of stuff belonging to the
Arabs. They had passed Shendy, and had not been
fired upon.</p>

<p>The Mahdi will be furious.</p>

<p>I do not think the resources of this place are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
known. We can turn out 50,000 rounds of Remington
ammunition a week, there are some 10,000
rounds of mountain-gun ammunition in store, and
if the Mahdi takes Kartoum (which will entail the
fall of every town in Soudan) it will need a large
force to stay his propaganda. According to the
Greek he meditates an invasion of Egypt and
Palestine, where they are all ready to rise.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> All
the steamers on the Nile, even below Assouan, are
but crockery, if struck by a mountain-gun shell;
consequently, if the people rose at Esneh they
could, by the Mahdi sending down two guns, stop
the river. The further the Mahdi is off from the
people who rise, the stronger he is; here we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
near him, and hear all about his festivities and
pepper business; at Esneh this would be lost in the
mists of distance, still more so at Cairo and in
Palestine. What have we done in Lower Egypt
to make them like us? Not a single thing. We
have foisted Europeans on them to the extent of
£450,000 a year; we have not reduced taxes, only
improved the way of extorting those taxes. The
Mahdi says, “I will take one-tenth of your produce,
and I will rid you of the ‘dogs’”&mdash;a most captivating
programme! If well led, and once he
takes Kartoum, the combined forces of France
and England will not be able to subdue him, unless
they go at his nest. From a <i>professional military
point of view</i>, and <i>speaking materially</i>, I wish I was
the Mahdi, and I would laugh at all Europe.
Query (believing all the above as I do)&mdash;would I be
justified in coming to terms with Mahdi, on the
understanding that he should let down all refugees
(on the Egerton contract arrangement), while I
should give over to him, unhurt, all warlike
material in Kartoum?</p>

<p>Certainly, according to the letter, I would be
justified in so doing; and <i>then</i> what! of what I
feel sure will happen, <i>i.e.</i>, a rising in Egypt occurs,
what will my nation say? (for Egerton will disappear
by some appointment in Chili) they will say it
is my fault; but (<i>D. V.</i>) they shall not say so, for
I will not give up the place except with my life.
It cannot be too strongly impressed on the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
that it is not the Mahdi’s forces which are to be
feared, but the rising of the populations by his
emissaries. I do not believe he had four thousand
men when he defeated Hicks. We have to think
what would a garrison of ten thousand men do in
Cairo if the population rose.</p>

<p>Had Zubair Pasha been sent up when I asked
for him, Berber would in all probability never have
fallen, and one might have made a Soudan Government
in opposition to the Mahdi. We choose to
refuse his coming up because of his antecedents
<i>in re</i> slave trade; granted that we had reason, yet
as we take no precautions as to the future of these
lands with respect to the slave trade, the above
opposition seems absurd. I will not send up A.
because he will do this, but I will leave the country
to B., who will do exactly the same.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 18.</i>&mdash;Men came to Halfeyeh from
Shendy, and report in further detail, the attack on
the market of Metemma,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and capture of a lot of
things. They report also the arrival of troops at
Dongola, and their advance towards Berber (saying
that a reconnaissance was just pushed out to ascertain
if Kartoum had fallen or not). Three escaped
soldiers came in from Arabs; they report that a lot
of troops are at Fashoda.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> I suppose those from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Equator or Bahr Gazelle; it appears they have been
at Fashoda some little time, and have lots of cows,
&amp;c. They did not like to come on, for they did
not know if Kartoum existed.</p>

<p>10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;A fight is going on between the
<i>Towfikia</i> steamer and five hundred of our men and
the Arabs, near Giraffe. The Arabs are retiring
towards the White Nile. I sent out the men
to get wood, &amp;c. The Arabs did ditto, thence the
collision.</p>

<p>The three men who came in to-day, say the Arabs,
seeing the numbers who desert them, take the rifles
from the men at night, and give them out by day.</p>

<p>These men say the Mahdi knows of the advance
of the troops on Berber, and is in a way about it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, previous to hearing the news of to-day,
I had arranged for the departure of the Greek
Consul and subjects to the Equator, and then their
retreat, <i>viâ</i> Zanzibar, but it will now be held in
abeyance, till we see the corroboration or not, of this
advance of troops to Berber.</p>

<p>The following meditations as to the future, may
save a good deal of talking: therefore I write them.
Supposing it to be true, an expeditionary force
comes to Berber, composed of partly British troops.
What will result? The Mahdi’s people will retire
still further into the interior, and some of his people
will come in. The chief of the expeditionary force
will say “Now the road from Kartoum to Berber is
open, retire the garrison.” He may say, “I will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
you three months to do it in.” Well, we send up
steamers to the Equator and Bahr Gazelle, and the
garrison of Kartoum marches on Sennaar and we get
down the refugees, and garrisons from those places.
Of course the moment it is known we are going to
evacuate, we drive all neutrals, and even friendlies
of the country into the arms of the Mahdi, for they
will calculate “We are going to be left, and consequently
we must, for our own interests, do something
for the Mahdi, in order to hedge our position.”
This means that arrayed against our evacuation will
be the mass of those living in our midst, and who
are now with us. This is disagreeable, but one
cannot help seeing that it is quite impossible to
keep British troops after January. Therefore I
maintain we must install Zubair with a subsidy or
give over country to the Sultan with a subsidy.
There is no option. If it is determined to do
neither, but to evacuate purely and simply, then
when the Sennaar garrison is brought down, give
me the steamers, and the black troops, who are
willing to go, and let me take them up to Equator,
while the expeditionary force goes down to Berber.
I must say I think this will be a mistake, to leave
the prisoners in Obeyed, and to let the Mahdi gain
Kartoum.</p>

<p>As for Kassala, it must be relieved, by a separate
expedition from Massowah and Senheit. Supposing
the evacuation, and non-establishment of a regular
government (under Zubair or the Turks) is determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
upon, the Mahdi would, on taking Kartoum,
think twice of moving on Egypt, if I was on his
rear at Equator, with all the steamers.</p>

<p>No one can feel more strongly than I do, that
January must see any British troops, who may come
up on their way down to Egypt, <i>coute que coute</i>.
This must be so, therefore I keep on, about giving
the country to Sultan, or installing Zubair, with
subsidies.</p>

<p>In the serail, we have a Turkey cock and five
Turkey hens. They were all very tame, but having
put the Turkey cock’s head under his wing, and
swung him into sleep, on one occasion, he is now
shy to come near me; however, if one goes to his
wives and scratches them he is furious, and comes
up with his neck of all colours, but keeps out of
range. I am sorry to say that one of his wives,
having sat with patience for three weeks on eggs,
and brought forth two chicks, <i>he killed them</i>; such
is the accusation lodged against him by the cook.
I think a Turkey cock, with every feather on end,
and all the colours of the rainbow on his neck, is
the picture of physical strength; his eye is an eye of
fire, and there is no doubt of his being angry when
he sees his wives touched. I am one of those who
believe in the fore and future existence of what we
call animals. We have the history of man, shaped
in the image and likeness of God. He had breathed
into him the breath of God, and became alive, while
the waters and earth were told to bring forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
animals <i>that had life already</i> (Gen. i. 20). “That
hath life.” Take Psalm viii. “What is man, Thou
hast put <i>all things</i> under his feet.” What a fall
there is in the next verse, “<i>All sheep and oxen</i>” and
turn to Hebrews ii. 8, where the same Psalm is
quoted, and where <i>all</i> things are subject to Him.
All principalities, powers, and every existence are
under Him. Why did the Psalmist go out of his
way to quote “sheep and oxen,” unless they were
(so to say) the incarnation of those powers and
principalities? Man, however much he has fallen,
has the grand pre-eminence over all creatures, <i>he
was shaped</i> (the word is the same as is used for a
potter making a clay vessel) <i>in God’s image and
likeness</i>, and it is only God who could have so
shaped him, as it is only God who knew His own
likeness. Also when our Lord took our form
(which he still keeps) as man, in Him dwelt the
fulness of the Godhead, so that there is no doubt
(as he differed only from us in being sinless) that
man is capable of containing the fulness of the Godhead.
Our belief is that <i>as man</i> our Lord governs
heaven and earth, not a sparrow falling without His
permission; this being so, the <i>capacity</i> of man must
be such as to allow of his being so endowed as to
rule all events in heaven and earth, for it is distinctly
said our Lord was incarnated in a similar
body to ours, except without sin. Our Lord, who
is now man for ever and ever, is not likely to have
taken a form which contained any hindrance to His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
fulness of His Godhead, therefore the form He took
must be perfect, and as our difference between Him
and us is our sin (which He has taken away), we,
in our turn, must be capable of realising His fulness
of Godhead, and my belief is that our future happiness
is in being finite intelligences. We will keep
on to all eternity, grasping the infinite knowledge of
God which we are so formed as to be able to do,
but which will last for ever inasmuch as He is
infinite. When one gets on these subjects, and has
to come down to this dreadful Soudan question, it
is depressing; so also is the thought that misery here
is our lot, for if we will be with our Master, we must
be like Him, who from His birth to His death may
be said to have been utterly miserable, as far as
things in this world are concerned: yet I kick at
the least obstacle to my will.</p>

<p>I certainly will, with all my heart and soul, do
my best if any of Her Majesty’s forces come up
here or to Berber, to send them down before
January, and will willingly take all the onus of
having done so. Truly the people are not worth
any <i>great</i> sacrifice, and we are only bound to them
because of our dubious conduct in Egypt, to which
bond there is a limit, which I fix in January. As
for the Kordofan Europeans, with one exception,
they have denied their Lord, and they deserve their
fate in some measure.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 19.</i>&mdash;The ex-Khedive always said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the great difficulty of governing the Soudan, was
the want of means of easy access, so he went into
a great scheme of railways; he always said that
the Government was bad, because of the immunity
which Governors enjoyed, owing to his being unable
to control them. The Soudan, if once proper communication
was established, would not be difficult
to govern. The only mode of improving the
access to the Soudan, seeing the impoverished
state of Egyptian finances, and the mode to do
so, without an outlay of more than £10,000, is by
the Nile.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-122.jpg" width="500" height="89"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Take this section to be the bed of Nile from
Kartoum from Assouan, <i>a b c d e f g</i> the cataracts;
place steamers on the open spaces between cataracts,
build small forts at cataracts, and a sure and
certain road is open for ever.</p>

<p>The same crews would do for these steamers,
for a weekly service would suffice. Camels should
be placed at the cataracts for the transhipment of
goods from steamer to steamer.</p>

<p>After the first outlay, which certainly would not
be more than £10,000, for we have the steamers
(I think £5000 would be enough), the thing would
pay itself. Of course, it would be better to make
loop tramways worked by animals, than to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
camels at the cataracts. I worked at this idea
quietly for the time<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I was in the Soudan before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Colonel Mason went down and examined the cataracts
between Hannek and Wady Halfa, and he
found one space of open water forty miles in length.
The Wady Halfa railway might be produced some
nine kilometres, and brought down to river bank.
The mass of the misfortunes of the Soudan arose
from this idea of utilising the Nile not having been
carried out, but one had to work at it quietly, for
Cairo was bent on the Wady Halfa railway over
which such sums had been spent. I even took
one steamer up from Wady Halfa to Dongola
(<i>i.e.</i>, Mr. Baird, C. E., did so), to begin the chain of
steamers.</p>

<p>No church parade to speak of; Arabs are now
visible only on the south front, four or five miles
distant. Arabs did not bring their gun down to the
Blue Nile to-day, and no escaped prisoners came
in. To-day is the Muslim Sabbath, and there is no
office work. (Not that there is much on other days;
however, one never sees anyone from morning till
night).</p>

<p>This has given me time to think over the outburst
of indignation <i>in re</i> the slave circular. We did
not see the papers, so can only guess what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
said, but expect that this diabolical fact caused
upraised hands in horror, “Was the world coming
to an end?” What complete rubbish! Was it not
announced openly that the Soudan was going to be
abandoned, and consequently that the Soudanese
were to be allowed to follow their own devices
(which are decidedly slave-huntingly inclined)? What
possible influence could my saying that that feeble
Treaty of 1877 was not going to be enforced, have
on people who were going to be abandoned? The
sole and only object of my mission was to get out
the garrisons and refugees without loss of life. And
in saying what I did I merely told the people a
platitude.</p>

<p>Baring deigned to say he would support me! Of
course, that was an enormous assistance, to have his
approbation. I expect that my asking for Zubair to
come up was the last drop in the cup, and henceforth
I was a complete pariah, yet, in reality, if the
Soudan was to be abandoned, what difference could
it possibly make whether Zubair or the Mahdi
carried on slave-hunting, for, according to all accounts,
the Mahdi is most active in this direction (so
says the Greek). We had decided to abandon the
Soudan, and to leave it to its own devices; the only
obstacle to this were those <i>horrid</i> garrisons; once
we could get them out, then chaos might reign, for
all we cared. The Arabs, foolishly, would not
let us return, consequently the present position.
Zubair’s coming up, when I asked for him, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
have, I think, saved Berber, and greatly facilitated
the getting down of <i>those</i> garrisons, which we only
care for, because it is a <i>palpable</i> dishonour to abandon
them, “they ought to have surrendered at once,
troublesome people that they are, giving so much
bother!”</p>

<p>Stewart will bear witness that my whole efforts
have been, and will be, directed to carry out my
instructions, viz., the withdrawal of the garrisons
and refugees, and had it not been for the defeat of
Mahomet Ali Pasha, I should have got out at least
two-thirds of those at Kartoum and Sennaar. I
was engaged in a certain work, <i>i.e.</i>, to take down
the garrisons, &amp;c. It suited me altogether to accept
this work (when once it was decided on to abandon
the Soudan), which, to my idea, is preferable to
letting it be under those wretched effete Egyptian
Pashas. Her Majesty’s Government agreed to send
me. It was a mutual affair, they owe me positively
nothing, and I owe them nothing. A Member of
Parliament, in one of our last received papers, asked
“whether officers were not supposed to go where
they were ordered?” I quite agree with his view,
but it cannot be said I was ordered to go. The
subject was too complex for any order. It was
“Will you go and try?” and my answer was, “Only
too delighted.” As for all that may be said of our
holding out, &amp;c., &amp;c., it is all twaddle, for we had
no option; as for all that may be said as to why I
did not escape with Stewart, it is simply because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the people would not have been such fools as to
have let me go, so there is an end of those greatcoats
of self-sacrifice, &amp;c. Place before men the
chance of success by holding out, and the certainty
of death, or miserable captivity, if they give in,
there is not much credit in holding out. I must
add <i>in re</i>, “the people not letting me go,” that
even if they had been willing for me to go, I would
not have gone and left them in their misery. I
think I say truly, I have never asked for a British
expedition. I asked for two hundred men to be
sent to Berber at a time when, Graham having
beaten Osman Digma, one might have supposed
there was no risk for those two hundred men, and
I asked for Zubair.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Baring offended Cuzzi, who revenged himself by
betraying Berber. Baring <i>openly</i> announced “that
no troops would come up to Berber,” which was a
gratuitous act on his part. We may be sure Cuzzi
(who loves Baring) did not fail to tell this to the
Mahdi, yet Baring pitched into me for indiscretion in
asking <i>openly</i> for Zubair,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which I did on <i>purpose</i>, in
order to save Her Majesty’s Government the odium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of such a step! As for Zubair’s refusing to come up
(as Cuzzi says he did), I put it down to some palace
intrigue, and consider (if it is true) he was forced into
saying so. If any Expedition comes up, I am grateful
<i>officially</i> for the people’s sake, but I consider that
it is a <i>right</i> they possess, for, had not Egypt been
interfered with, somewhat more than seven persons
would have come up here, as reinforcements, between
21st November, 1883, when Hicks’ defeat was
known, and 19th September, 1884. <i>I</i> am grateful
<i>personally</i>, because, as surely as the chief of that
expedition comes up, I will put on him the burthen
of the Government (doing what I can to help him).
I am unable to forget the sufferings of these peoples,
owing to our want of decision <i>in re</i> Zubair, and
no soft words will obliterate those sufferings
from my memory. It is not over praiseworthy if
one holds out, when, if you do <i>not</i>, your throat is
cut.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to those who have prayed
for us.</p>

<p>Any expeditionary force that may come up comes
up for the honour of England, and England will be
grateful, and I can hang the yoke of Government
on some one else, for the solution of the problem.</p>

<p>Any one reading the telegram<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> 5th May,
Suakin, 29th April, Massowah, and <i>without</i> date,
Egerton saying, “Her Majesty’s Government does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
not entertain your proposal to supply Turkish or
other troops in order to undertake military operations
in Soudan, and consequently if you stay at
Kartoum you should state your reasons,” might
imagine one was luxuriating up here, whereas,
I am sure, no one wishes more to be out of it than
myself; the “<i>reasons</i>” are those horridly plucky
Arabs.</p>

<p>I own to having been very insubordinate to Her
Majesty’s Government and its officials, but it is my
nature, and I cannot help it. I fear I have not even
tried to play battledore and shuttlecock with them.
I know if <i>I</i> was chief I would never employ <i>myself</i>,
for I am incorrigible. To men like Dilke, who
weigh every word, I must be <i>perfect poison</i>. I
wonder what the telegrams about Soudan have cost
Her Majesty’s Government? It has been truly a
horrid question. There is the <span class="smcap">Town</span> El Obeyed
and the <span class="smcap">Sheikh</span> El Obeyed; there is the Haloman
of Cairo and the Haloman of Kartoum. Sanderson
must have a hard time of it. “The <i>city</i> moves
about!” “Why, if Haloman is attacked, Cairo must
be in danger! Send for Wolseley! Kartoum forces
defeated by Sheikh el Obeyed! Why, the town
must have moved! Is not El Obeyed the place
Hicks went to take? Most extraordinary! Send
for Wolseley!”</p>

<p>“Eureka, I have found it out; there is a <i>man</i>
called <i>El Obeyed</i> and a <i>town</i> called <i>El Obeyed</i>.
When a movement occurs, it is the <i>man</i>, not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<i>town</i>, which has moved!” After <i>this</i> I shall hesitate
to ask for any appointment from Foreign
Office, and I shall get no more crisp bank-notes, as
I used to do from old Cunnynghame in 1858-59
(when Alston was a boy, so to say), in those dingy
rooms in Downing Street, now pulled down. One
can fancy them saying “That brute of a Mahdi!”
“That horrid resurrection of Stewart, Power, and
Herbin at Dongola!” It will destroy all the <i>well
earned repose</i> of Her Majesty’s Government. As
Sir Wilfrid Lawson (he is an <i>irregular</i>) said, “One
day you will groan when you hear of Tel el
Kebir.” I think of <i>all</i> the pusillanimous <i>businesses</i>
which happened in 1882 the flight of the Europeans
from Alexandria before these wretched fellaheen
troops, was the worst. Why, had they barricaded
their streets, they would have held Alexandria
against 50,000 of these poor things (like Abbot did
his hotel and the Egyptian bank their offices). A
more contemptible soldier than the Egyptian never
existed. Here we never count on them; they are
held in supreme contempt, poor creatures. <i>They</i>
never go out to fight; it would be perfectly iniquitous
to make them. We tried it once, and they refused
point blank to leave the steamers. We are keeping
them in cotton wool to send down to Baring (if he
has weathered the storm?)</p>

<p>“Blessed is the man who does not sit in the seat
of the <i>scornful</i>” (Ps. i. 1). I own it is not right to
scoff at one’s superiors, but I do not do it in malice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and I hope those who are remarked upon will not
be offended. Life is a very leaden business, and if
any one can lighten it, so much the better. Because
I criticise Baring, Egerton, and the Foreign Office,
it is not that I think I am their superior, but
because I would like them to see how others, outside
themselves, view things. Because I may differ
with them it is no reason why they may not be right,
and acting uprightly, and I may be utterly wrong.
I am sure the “Siren” Malet is conscientiously sure
all he did in Egypt was right; if visited in Brussels
one will see, at a glance, he is plainly content.</p>

<p>One of the most amusing things which struck
me in Palestine, exemplifying how little worth
the world’s praise is, was an article in the <i>Times</i>
describing the making of a D.C.L. at Oxford. Sir
Charles Wilson received this honour. The <i>Times,</i>
in remarking on the affair, mixed Wilson, R.E.,
up with Rivers Wilson of National Debt Office,
and spoke of his “financial capacities” in Egypt.
Of course Wilson, R.E., could not help thinking
he had been robbing Wilson of National Debt
Office of his renown, while Rivers Wilson felt
hurt at being robbed of it. Two people were
accordingly put out; while the innocent writer in
the <i>Times</i>, when penning his article, was thinking
how he could meet his rent (this is pure supposition).
We may be quite certain, that Jones cares more
for where he is going to dine, or what he has got
for dinner, than he does for what Smith has done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
so we need not fret ourselves for what the world
says. The article in the <i>Times</i> was a Mordecai
to Wilson, R.E., and quite destroyed the pleasure
of receiving the D.C.L.; yet the writer in the <i>Times</i>
did all he could to exalt Wilson, R.E. I think
the Press is first-rate, to ventilate articles; but when
“we” come out, and praise or blame, I do not care
a bit for “we”; for I have seen the “We’s,” and
found them much as myself. I would never muzzle
the press or its correspondents; they are most useful,
and one cannot be too grateful to them (I own this
more than any one), but I certainly think, that their
province does not extend to praising or blaming a
man, for by praising, or blaming, an assumption is
made of superiority, for the <i>greater</i> only can do that,
to the <i>inferior</i>; and no newspaper can arrogate that
its correspondent is superior to the General (though
I declare I think, sometimes, it may be the case).</p>

<p>Take for instance our defeat here, on the 16th
March, which is put down to the treachery of the
Pashas. Ten thousand articles in the <i>Times</i> will
not make me think that their execution was not a
judicial murder, yet probably the <i>Times</i> may say, I
was justified: it alters not the affair with me, it is
simply my intelligence against that of their correspondent;
if the <i>Times</i> saw this in print, it would
say, “Why, then, did you act as you did?” to which
I fear I have no answer.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 20.</i>&mdash;Six escaped soldiers came in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
morning with their arms; they say that the others
meditate a general rush for the lines to escape, that
the Arabs are quite astonished at our being so quiet,
and believe a mine is being driven under them.
The men who came to-day said the Mahdi is still
at Rahad! <i>not</i> at Schatt. One of these men was
a perfect peacock with the patches on his dervish
dress. Yesterday evening, while a gale was blowing,
Waled a Goun took out the Krupp, meaning to
bombard us, but he then took it back on Abou
Gugliz’ remonstrances, who said that we had stayed
quiet for months, that he had made splendid fortresses,
and that on one day we had burst on him,
and broken him up.</p>

<p>A curious letter<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was found written, just before
Hicks’ forces perished, by a high officer; it is in
the terms, “Stranger, go tell the Lacedemonians we
lie here, in obedience to their laws.”</p>

<p>I have in a previous page abused the Egyptian
soldier, but it is not just, for what possible interest
can they take in warlike operations in the Soudan?
The English beat them in Egypt, and then sent
them up here to be massacred in detail. One may
say the massacred ten thousand of Hicks’ army, at
any rate, showed they could die, if they could not
fight.</p>

<p>When we got hemmed in, a lot of slaves belonging
to masters in Kartoum got cut off. They
have been coming in in driblets ever since, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
made the men soldiers, and the women were freed;
this of course bore hard on their masters, who thus
lost their slaves, so I have determined to compensate
these masters, at rate of £7 per man, £5 per
woman, being an inferior article. Certainly I would
make ‘Plutarch’s Lives’ a handbook for our young
officers; it is worth any numbers of ‘Arts of War’
or ‘Minor Tactics.’</p>

<p>Some accounts in the <i>Gazette</i>, describing reasons
for giving the Victoria Cross, are really astounding,
such as a man who, with another, was sent out on
a reconnaissance, this other was wounded, and his
companion waited for him, and took him on his
horse, saving his life! What would we have said,
had he left his companion? Lots of these cases
pass by unheeded, which, if read by ‘Plutarch’s
Lives,’ would be simply a man’s duty. A soldier is
bound entirely to his work as a soldier, he can never
do more than his duty, and his <i>métier</i> is the Field;
therefore he deserves nothing, for he is already paid
for that <i>métier</i>, and not for garrison or home life.
The original idea of the Victoria Cross was to give
the subaltern officers, non-commissioned officers, and
men a decoration, which would take the place of
the Bath, to ranks below that of Major, which
by the statutes of the Bath could not be done; then
came the mistake to give the Victoria Cross for
deeds of <i>éclat</i>, and so now it is. I like that old
Iron Duke with his fearful temper: he told a friend
of my father, who was bewailing his long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
meritorious service, “That he ought to be &mdash;&mdash; glad
the country had kept him so long.” I wish
Wolseley would take up this line, and get some
quixotic chivalry into us: that it is possible I feel
sure, for we are the same men as before. In three
campaigns, out of four of late years, no officer or
soldier has gone through such privations or dangers,
as are gone through by our naval officers and sailors
in gunboats, in various parts of the world, yet these
latter would be scoffed at if they pleaded these
privations, in order to get reward. A man defends
a post, if he loses it his throat is cut; why give him
a Victoria Cross? and if given, why not give it to
all who were with him? they equally with him
defended their throats. The men I should like to
see cross-questioned on the country they are in are
our Generals, whose whole time is taken up in their
offices with courts-martial, &amp;c., &amp;c., an occasional
day being devoted to moving men about in formations,
which are never put into execution in the
Field? The <i>métier</i> of a General is the Field, not
the office; it is as if all their time is to be taken up
with the horse in the stable, not in the country,
whereas the latter is the most important. I should
like to see Wolseley trot out the generals over their
districts; ask them the routes, their proposed distribution
of men in case of attack, and water-supply to
Forts. I do not think it is generally known that if
a gunboat cut the sea-wall near Cooling on Thames,
the Cliffe and Shornemead Forts are cut off from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
main land, and that the Thames would come up to
high lands, and be ten miles wide. There is one
man only that I know who has the gift of questioning,
because he knows every part of the coast, Sir
W. Jervois; and if Wolseley has not the time, he
would do schoolmaster. Of course, this is all fearful
treason and presumption.</p>

<p>Spy in Halfeyeh states Stewart’s steamers have
recaptured the two steamers I had lost at Berber,
and had no fighting to speak of; that the English
troops are advancing on Ambukol,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> half way between
Debbeh and Merowé, and had defeated the Arabs.</p>

<p>A young black soldier has just escaped from the
Arabs; he was pursued by three horsemen and
some footmen, and he kept blazing away at them
till he got into the lines. He says he killed two of
his pursuers.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> to Abdel Kader, the old sheikh
on South Front, and sent him a packet of soap with
the letter, as he had lamented to one of our men,
who had escaped, that he had none. I daresay he
will think the packet is a mine!</p>

<p>I have ordered the sale of five hundred ardebs
of Government dhoora: no one family to purchase
more than two ardebs.</p>

<p>The capture of the steamers at Berber cuts off
the Arabs of Berber from those on other side.</p>

<p>With the young soldier who escaped were three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
others, but their hearts failed them, and they were
recaptured. I fear they will suffer, but no physical
suffering will change the heart, hence I do not
believe in purgatory.</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up to Giraffe, and as
the Arabs had a sort of sneaking affection for the
place, we put down twenty self-exploding mines, to
deter them from going there. The worst of it is,
our domestic matches have run out, and we cannot
make any substitute, so we have to fall back on the
powder-hose, connecting groups of ten. I think
good wire entanglements, with mines, will defend
any place, if one has anything like moderate troops
behind the parapet. Wire entanglement ought to
be twenty yards in depth, mixed with it the earthmines.
No field artillery will neutralize their effects,
and only a continuous bombardment of days would
destroy them.</p>

<p>A man has come in from Shendy, who corroborates
the advance of the expeditionary force and
the defeat of the Arabs. Another came in, who
says the <i>Abbas</i> passed down safely, and that the
steamers <i>Mansowrah</i> and <i>Saphia</i> are on their
return, but says nothing of capture of the two
steamers at Berber.</p>

<p>Another escaped soldier came in.</p>

<p>The Arabs took the man with the flag of truce
(I sent out with letter to Abdel Kader, the old
sheikh) into their lines; he took a <i>letter</i> from the
Ulemas to the Mahdi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Tolerably good information says that the Mahdi
has written to the tribes about here, telling them
to submit to our authority, and to fight no more, to
pay taxes, &amp;c.; that if he is the Mahdi, then Turks
and all men will eventually acknowledge him, without
any more fighting, &amp;c. We have this from
two separate sources. I think he feels that to fail
here would lead to his fall, and so he will come to
terms in order to keep Kordofan, as I originally
proposed to him.</p>

<p>Faki Mustapha (the man who commanded Arabs
on left bank), has sent in to say he never wrote
the impertinent letter E,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to which his seal was
not.</p>

<p>The doctor took a stone as big as a swan’s-egg
from a man to-day.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a civil war to show what
skunks men are. One of my greatest worries are the
Shaggyeh, who are continually feathering towards
me, or towards the Mahdi. I expect both sides
despise them equally. According to history, the
same thing went on during the reign of James II.
When William of Orange landed, Queen Anne’s
husband the Prince of Denmark did not show well
in the affair, and I expect that the Empress
Eugenie could say a good deal for “Rats,” during
her time. I must say I cordially hate them, and if
I had my way, I would smite the Shaggyeh, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
policy says “give them rope.” I have told them
distinctly, that I know it is self-interest alone which
rules them, which however is a platitude, for it
governs most of us.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 21.</i>&mdash;Six more escaped soldiers came
in with their rifles to-day. They say the Arabs are
furious at losing their Peacock dervish (who was
one of their officers) yesterday, and also at the
constant desertions, and have written to the Mahdi
to ask whether they are to kill these blacks or not.
The Mahdi hired one thousand camels at $3 a head,
to bring dhoora to the Arab camp, but the people
who engaged to do this, bolted with the money and
the camels into the interior. The Mahdi is at
Schatt.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Messengers have arrived at Omdurman, saying
that mixed force of British and Indian troops at
Debbeh, on the Nile, north of Dongola, and that
they had defeated a party of dervishes.</p>

<p>The Greek, who came in a few days ago from the
Arabs, said the Mahdi had given Cuzzi an ointment
to rub on his body, which would keep him in odour
of sanctity!</p>

<p>Halfeyeh reports a foraging party of Arabs between
Halfeyeh and Shoboloha.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The three messengers from Dongola came in with
two cipher telegrams from Egerton of same import,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
not legible, for want of cipher, which Stewart
carried off. Some photograph letters which I could
only partially make out, and notes from Floyer,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and
Kitchener<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> saying forces were coming up. Letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
from Mudir Dongola saying he had beaten the
Arabs four times before the British advance! I
have made him Pasha, and asked for the Order
of St. Michael and St. George for him from the
Khedive. I have ordered <i>three</i> guns to be fired
from all the guns at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> as a salute, and to warn
the Arabs something is up. I shall send down
spies to-morrow. I gave the <i>three</i> £50, and gave
them each £10, with promise they will be paid £10
more when they get to Dongola. They say they
had nothing given them on starting! which is
curious if true.</p>

<p>Three more escaped soldiers came in this afternoon.
They say the Arabs have disarmed all the
black troops, and have told them to go where they
liked, so I expect we will have a lot in to-morrow.</p>

<p>We fired a salute of three rounds from each gun
on lines, to let the Arabs know of the advance
expeditionary force. The men who came in say
the Arabs were fully expecting an attack, and were
in a great way.</p>

<p>I send down to-morrow a telegram to Cairo, which
will settle the business as far as I am concerned. It
is thus couched: “If you remove me from being
Governor-General then all responsibility is off me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
but if you keep me as Governor-General then I
will, <i>at the cost of my commission</i> in Her Majesty’s
Service, see all refugees out of this country.”</p>

<p>The Arabs in reply to this salute of three guns
fired nine shots against the lines to-night, two of
which passed over our lines&mdash;a sort of revenge for
our salute.</p>

<p>The man who went up with the letter came back
with two letters<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and the soap, <i>which was refused</i>.</p>

<p>Our salute, which was replied to by the Arabs by
shotted guns, made us fire shotted guns in reply;
and the “man who came in with the soap” says our
guns killed twenty men, which I fear is an exaggeration.
This man says the Arabs are in a bad state,
with little food. They threatened to kill him. I
sent out letter<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> in answer.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 22.</i>&mdash;One escaped slave came in to-day.
The Berber steamers are said to be coming up river.
Sent out two hundred men from Halfeyeh to drive
off foraging parties of Arabs investing roads from
that place to Shoboloha.</p>

<p>The <i>Saphia</i> and <i>Mansowrah</i> have returned from
Berber. <i>They passed the Abbas</i>, that is about all,
and I am grateful for that. They carried out
my orders. Colonel Stewart’s letter reports in
detail. The steamers lost three killed, and had four
wounded. They saw the two captured steamers
under the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;When self-acting mines are placed, it is as
well to connect them with twine to facilitate taking
them up.</p>


<p><i>September 23.</i>&mdash;The men who went out to drive
back the marauders between Halfeyeh and Shoboloha
have come back. They drove back the Arabs
and captured a lot of things.</p>

<p>During the blockade here, viz., from say March 12th
till to-day September 22nd we have expended&mdash;</p>

<p>Fifty Arab horsemen came down on our foraging
party who were outside Bourré, but the steamer
drove them back.</p>

<p>No escaped soldiers came in to-day. I expect
they are all close prisoners.</p>

<p>There are fifty nuggars at Berber with the
Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>I am sure I should like that fellow Egerton. There
is a light-hearted jocularity about his communications,
and I should think the cares of life sat easily
on him. Notice the slip in margin. He wishes
to know <i>exactly</i> “day, hour, and minute” that he
(Gordon) expects to be in “difficulties as to provisions
and ammunition.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Now I really think if Egerton was to turn over the
“archives” (a delicious word) of his office, he would
see we had been in difficulties for provisions for
some months. It is as if a man on the bank,
having seen his friend in river already bobbed down
two or three times, hails, “I say, old fellow, let us
know when we are to throw you the life buoy, I
know you have bobbed down two or three times,
but it is a pity to throw you the life buoy until you
really are <i>in extremis</i>, and I want to know <i>exactly</i>,
for I am a man brought up in a school of exactitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
though I did <i>forget</i>(?) to date my June telegram
about <i>that Bedouin escort contract</i>.”</p>

<p>Turn to page 59, “Send for Wolseley,” &amp;c. I
see that they did send for him just a month before;
“nasty moving cities, and <i>very</i> nasty Soudan.”</p>

<p>Egerton’s cipher telegram,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> which I cannot decipher
through Stewart having taken the book, is
short, but I feel sure is weighty, and I regret
deeply I cannot get at its contents, which I think
would afford matter for amusing comment.</p>

<p>The Mudir of Dongola sent me a telegram which
is on other side.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> He tells me of the extreme
anxietude which pervaded Cairo (when they heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Berber had fallen, and it was rumoured Kartoum
had ditto), for the retirement of the Dongola people.
“Throw things into the river,” &amp;c., “but come
away,” “we are very fond of you,” “useless to
stay,” &amp;c., &amp;c. The Mudir laughs over it, I think,
and saw the kind instruction, “raise barrier on
barrier between Kartoum and its sister beleagured
cities and Cairo; let us hear the last of these
moving cities and Halomans.” What awful disgust
at this resurrection! I made the Mudir a
Pasha; he was an old officer of mine. When I
came up I ordered him down, as my orders were
to <i>organize country with Soudanese employés</i>, not
that he was bad. Cairo (how they must wring
their hands over it now) remonstrated and asked
me to leave him, which I did, and he saved
Dongola, and indirectly Kartoum, for had I put
a native in he would have gone over to the
Mahdi, like Hussein Pasha Khalifa did, and then I
really think that the tomb would have been securely
sealed, and R. I. P. to all of us. When one thinks
that <i>Cairo saved us</i> by interfering with my removal
of this man, it must add bitterness to the cup they
have to drink!  The telegrams about this man’s
reinstatement, and my answer, are in Stewart’s
journal about the month of March.</p>

<p>I am arranging attack on Berber with four
steamers and Krupps, as soon as steamers come
from Sennaar.</p>

<p>Spies with letters started for Dongola yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope Stewart will get hold of all copies of
telegrams sent to us from Cairo for his journal, and
which the Arabs captured (lovely reading!), also
that he will find out result of Hewitt’s Mission to
King John, and of Baring’s negotiations for opening
of “the road from Suakim and Berber,” he spoke
about on the 29th of March! which caused hilarity
up here, and which led to his angering Cuzzi, who,
idiot-like, questioned the sagacity and success of
the step, and, getting turned out, paid us both (in
all probability) by betraying Berber to the Arabs.</p>

<p>Egerton is a statistician, he evidently is collecting
material for some great work. What earthly use is
it to us for Egerton “to know exactly our want of
provisions,” when he is 1500 miles away! I am
vexed at not getting at the pith of his cipher
telegram, all I can see is that 7775 (Zubair’s name)
is <i>not</i> in it.</p>

<p>I am preparing to clear out of the palace, <i>in
toto</i>, leaving the telegraph only, and go into the
Mudiriat, so there will be plenty of room for the
staff, if they come up, which is even now a question
to me.</p>

<p>From Lord Northbrook coming out, I infer that
Baring has returned to Cairo, and that my friend
Egerton has gone back to the Acropolis. I hope he
will say a good word to the King of Hellenes in
favour of Leonidas, the Greek Consul here, who has
behaved worthy of his ancestor of Thermopylæ, on
a small scale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>I have a firm conviction we will not do anything
in Egypt that will succeed, unless we fall into
accord with France, which would not be difficult
to do.</p>

<p>Arabi Pasha’s private secretary, who even Stewart
with all his Job-like patience had to give up as a bad
job, came to-day to say “he was starving,” so I
have given him £10 a month again. How he ever
got on with Arabi is a wonder; he and Stewart
used to spend hours, hob and nob, translating
Arabic letters, and then Stewart found out that the
man had just exercised his own imaginations and
taken not the least pains to give the sense of these
letters’ contents.</p>

<p>The Shaggyeh are breaking my heart with their
family quarrels. I shall go to Halfeyeh (<i>D. V.</i>) to-morrow
to see after them. They captured five men
who had been pardoned, and had gone back to the
Arabs, and want me to kill them, which I refuse to
do, for who are the rebels? we or the Arabs. I
am responsible for the judicial murder of the two
Pashas; beyond this I have put no man to death.</p>

<p>I think Colonel Stewart is hard on our men as to
their cowardice; they are not heroes, I grant, but
they are not, to my mind, entire cowards; “they
do not see it,” that is all; but if they are put in
a position where there is a chance, a <i>fair</i> chance of
success, they will take advantage of it and be
plucky. The Chinese are of the same temperament.
“No two piecey man can stay one place, supposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
you come, I must go.” This is an acknowledged
maxim in the East.</p>

<p>A spy came in, and says that Sheikh el Obeyed
has news in his camp <i>that Abdel Kader Pasha</i> (what
a bother for Sanderson all these Abdel Kaders who
he may mix up with the one of Algier) <i>is with
troops at Kassala</i>.</p>

<p>Two more mines exploded at Omdurman when
they were being taken up to renew the fuses, but
did no harm.</p>

<p>I saw the Shaggyeh chief Abdul Hamed to-day.
He says that Said and Ibrahim Hassan Pashas<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
were <i>not guilty</i>, and that the Arabs looted their
houses when they heard they had been killed by
me, which they would not have done had they been
really in communication with them. I shall send
for their families and give them each £1000, which
is all I can do.</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> went up and had her usual fight
with the Arabs.</p>

<p>Report is that a soldier has taken the breech
pieces of the two Krupp guns with the Arabs, and
has run away, rendering them useless.</p>

<p>If Abdel Kader is at Kassala what on earth are
our people about not to tell me, for of course I
could help him. We seem to have lost our heads
in the Intelligence Department, though it costs
enough money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>As for “<i>evacuation</i>,” it is one thing; as for
“<i>ratting out</i>,” it is another. I am quite of advice
as to No. 1 (as we have not the decision to keep
the country), but I will be no party to No. 2 (this
“rat” business), 1st, because it is <i>dishonourable</i>;
2nd, because it is not <i>possible (which will have more
weight)</i>; therefore, if it is going to be No. 2, <i>the
troops had better not come beyond Berber till the
question of what will be done is settled</i>. So I will end
this book.</p>

<p><i>September 24.</i>&mdash;My view is this, as to the operations
of British forces. I will put three steamers,
each with two guns on them, and an armed force
of infantry at disposal of any British authority, will
send these steamers to either Metemma, opposite
Shendy, or to the cataract below Berber, to there
meet any British Force which may come across
country to the Nile. These steamers, with this
force coming across country, will (<i>D.V.</i>) capture
Berber and then communicate with Kartoum. The
steamers will have a month’s provisions. I would
not attempt to pass the <i>bulk</i> of British Force across
country, only the fighting column, to co-operate with
the three steamers. No artillery is wanted with
either force; it is not needed in any way in this
country. When Berber is taken I should keep the
bulk of the forces there, and send up the fighting
column to Kartoum, after having arranged for its
provisions, for I cannot feed them; then, in combination
with us, clear out rebels from A to B,&mdash;an affair
of a week; then decide on your future policy. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
is absolutely necessary to understand that we cannot
hurry over this affair.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> If we do we will incur disaster.
I have spoken of the division of British forces into
two lots, one a small fighting column co-operating
across country with the steamers which will meet
them, where you like, on the left bank of the White
Nile; the other, composed of bulk, <i>without artillery</i>,
coming up right bank of the Nile. Now if I were
doing this, I should, by the <i>Abbas</i> steamer, work up
by Merowé,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Abou Hamed, to Berber, by a <i>series of
small stations</i> with small garrisons. I should at once
get on each step of the Nile ladder steam launches
from Cairo, &amp;c., and put them in the open strips as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
previously explained in page 49 of my journal, Vol.
No. I.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> I then have my route open to Dongola
where the bulk of the forces remain.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-154.jpg" width="400" height="486"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Saying the chain of posts is established, that,
in the interim, the Arab forces at A and B are
dispersed, then you say <i>evacuate</i>. Well, without
moving the bulk, and, with the aid of the fighting
column, you can get down the Sennaar lot, while
steamers can bring down the Equator and Bahr
Gazelle garrisons. Now this will take at least six
months from the <i>present date</i> (for you will <i>not</i> come
for <i>a month</i>).  You then begin your downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
march, and are harassed all the way,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and the Mahdi
will say he kicked you out. You see you are in for
six months, and if you evacuate all your prestige
vanishes. It is therefore, I say, either, when once
you have got up to Kartoum, give the country to
the Turks, or else establish Zubair, and (instead of
expending time in going up to Sennaar and the
Equator) combinating with us, commence an attack
upon Kordofan. You must be here six months.
How will you spend the time? Will you at the
end of six months allow it to be said you are kicked
out, or will you not establish some government and
retire with dignity. The <i>cost</i> is the same in both
cases in money; but in honour one costs a great deal
more. If Zubair falls, after some time, what is it to
you? You did your best and save your honour,
and you save a mint of difficulties and troubles,
which these expeditions to Sennaar and Equator
involve. You will not be obliged to go fifty miles
beyond Kartoum.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> As for the Equator, give it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
me, and I will (<i>D.V.</i>) keep it from Zubair. It is a
thousand pities to give up Kartoum to the Mahdi
when there is a chance of keeping it under Zubair.</p>

<p>The fighting force can take the guns of the
steamers, if they need artillery; they are very good
guns and have field carriages with limbers. I shall
not send down the castellated barges or the Krupp
guns. Should you cross the desert <i>en masse</i>, the
way to guard your communications is to occupy, with
a company, all the wells in a good large radius, for
the Arabs cannot come down on your line of communication,
not being able to get water. This is
the only way to deal with the Bedouins, or slave
hunters.</p>

<p>The elephants came up by the wells of Gabra,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
direct from Debbeh to Kartoum. Care should be
taken on approaching Omdurman, for there are
rather a timid lot there (fellaheen).</p>

<p>You must consider whether you will not send
down those dreadful Bashi Bazouks, the scum of
Alexandria, and the fellaheen soldiers, on arrival, for
they are of little use, and eat us up.</p>

<p>For my part, I should not hesitate to ride down
with three hundred men (having taken precaution
to have made arrangements with the Kababish
tribe) from Kartoum to Debbeh.</p>

<p>There is no difficulty in making flying bridges
across the Nile with the country boats, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wide, using telegraph wire twisted in six or eight
strands.</p>

<p>Seyd Mahomet Osman’s little boy, aged nine
years, was caught by Arabs, and behaved like a
hero: “He was not going to be a Dervish. He
was as much the Mahdi as Mahomet Achmet; and
they might kill him if they liked, &amp;c. He was going
to stay with the Government and Gordon Pasha.”
They left him alone.</p>

<p>The Sandjak described the scene as splendid: the
little fellow with flaming eyes, gesticulating and
stamping with fury.</p>

<p>“U. S. C.,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> 6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Did you ever hear of such
a thing? &mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> is appointed &mdash;&mdash; to &mdash;&mdash;. A more
barefaced job never <i>was</i> perpetrated. Why, the
man has done nothing, <i>absolutely</i> nothing. Atrocious!
But <i>what</i> can you expect? The whole lot
of them are off again, a regular autumn flight!
What! eh! <i>you will see them all at Christmas</i>”
(waxing more wrath). “I declare I have half a mind
to go to the Mahdi,” &amp;c. Page interrupts: “Lady
&mdash;&mdash; is waiting in the brougham.”  Collapse and
exit.</p>

<p>I cannot too much impress on you that this
expedition will not encounter any enemy worth the
name in an European sense of the word; the
struggle is with the climate and destitution of the
country. It is one of time and patience, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
small parties of determined men, backed by native
allies, which are got by policy and money.
A heavy lumbering column, however strong,
is nowhere in this land. Parties of forty or sixty
men, swiftly moving about, will do more than any
column. If you lose two or three, what of it&mdash;it is
the chance of war. Native allies above all things, at
whatever cost. It is the country of the irregular, not
of the regular. If you move in mass you will find
no end of difficulties; whereas, if you let detached
parties dash out here and there, you will spread
dismay in the Arab ranks. The time to attack is
the dawn, or rather before it (this is stale news), but
sixty men would put these Arabs to flight just before
dawn, which one thousand would not accomplish in
daylight. This was always Zubair’s tactics. The
reason is that the strength of the Arabs is their
horsemen, who do not dare to act in the dark. I do
hope you will not drag on that artillery: it can only
produce delay and do little good. I can say I owe
the defeats in this country to having artillery with
me, which delayed me much, and it was the artillery
with Hicks which, in my opinion, did for him.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten thousand times better for us to perish than
for you to run the risk; and besides that, I have a
confident belief we will not (<i>D.V.</i>) perish. The
usual hammer and tongs fusillade will go on, but
they will not attack the place, and we will not go
out against them; while you will creep on quietly
and safely, and send out your feelers, making raids
upon these Arabs. I would let Buller have full
swing for all these little biting expeditions. I believe
he is well off (and I think not married, which is an
enormous advantage); and he and his subordinates
will learn scouting, &amp;c., in a good school. It is this
very same warfare we will have to exercise if
ever we would oppose Russia in her advance on
Afghanistan&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, of going up and landing in the
Persian Gulf, and cutting in on their flank. So it
will be a good school for him and his.</p>

<p>The wretched peasant, with that filthy cloth,
which you see, is a determined warrior, who can
undergo thirst and privation, who no more cares for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
pain or death than if he were of stone. The young
fellows even have a game by which they test who
will bear the lash of the hippopotamus’ whip best.
They are in their own land; the pains of war are
their ordinary life; and they are supported by religion
of a fanatical kind, influenced by the memory
of years of suffering at the hands of an effete set of
Bashi Bazouks. No; if our Kentish or Yorkshire
boys are to come up to help me, it is not with my
wish, unless with the greatest precaution. Thank
God we have few Europeans here, and those I can
(<i>D.V.</i>) care for, and you need not fear for our
retreat; and if we die, why, when we entered the
army we sold our lives at so much a day. I verily
believe no merchant would give me £200, which, to
me, is the current value of <i>the man</i> in this world.</p>

<p>It is the most extraordinary thing, quite incomprehensible,
that with only one exception, that of
Zubair’s man who came from Cairo (with Egerton’s
famous despatch about contracts), not one single
messenger has entered this place on the proper
initiative of outsiders. It has been invariably
<i>my</i> messengers, who were sent out by me, from
Kartoum, who did bring me any news. It would
seem as if those outside seemed to think it was
my duty to send out and bring in news for myself,
and that they had nothing to do with it. Either
these officers outside do not care to spend a sou
in spies to give me information, or else they think
it is a matter of supreme indifference, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I know what is going on or not; and I must say
when my messengers do come back, they bring
me scarcely any information of import. There
is a lot of “I hope you are well,” &amp;c.; men like
Kitchener and Chermside might be expected to
have more brains than that.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> If I had not exerted
myself in the spy business, we never would have
had a word, I verily believe. I never saw such a
poor lot as these outsiders. Even if they had had
to pay £20 out of their own pockets, one might
have expected them to do it, considering the circumstances.
They might have been paid back. But
neither Her Majesty’s Ministers in Cairo, nor these
men have seemed to care a jot to inform us. Silly
foolish questions are all we ever have got from
them, and it is not to be wondered at, that I am
indignant with such unpatriotic conduct, and not
inclined to be over civil beyond my duty. I
never saw such a feeble lot in my life! One has
only to compare the telegrams, &amp;c., we sent down,
with the <i>rubbish</i> sent in by <i>our own messengers I</i>
paid for.</p>

<p>Two children and three escaped soldiers came in
to-day from the Arabs, but had no news.</p>

<p>Read “Floyer’s” telegram, with Kitchener’s note
to Stewart on same paper&mdash;it perfectly exasperates
one. Kitchener asks Stewart “what he can do
for him”&mdash;nothing of what has gone on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
respect to the Soudan since Graham’s expedition.
Of course men are not <i>obliged</i> to write at all.</p>

<p>I  altogether <i>decline</i> the imputation that the projected
expedition has come to <i>relieve me</i>. It has
<i>come to SAVE OUR NATIONAL HONOUR
in extricating the garrisons, &amp;c., from a position
our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons</i>. <i>I
was relief expedition No 1.</i> They are <i>relief expedition
No 2.</i> As for myself I could make good my
retreat at any moment if I wished. Now realise
what would happen if this <i>first relief expedition</i>
was to bolt and the steamers fell into the hands
of the Mahdi: <i>this second relief expedition</i> (for the
honour of England engaged in extricating garrisons)
would be somewhat hampered. We the <i>first</i> and
<i>second</i> expeditions are equally engaged for the
honour of England. This is fair logic. <i>I came up
to extricate the garrisons and failed. Earle comes up
to extricate garrisons and (I hope) succeeds. Earle
does not come to extricate me.</i><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The extrication of
the garrisons was supposed to affect our “national
honour.” If Earle succeeds the “national honour”
thanks him and I hope rewards him, but it is altogether
independent of me, who for failing incurs its
blame.  I am not the <i>rescued lamb</i>, and I will
not be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Gessi dared to have communicated with me
like these men have, he would have heard of it; but
he never did.</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up and saw no Arabs
at Giraffe to-day.</p>

<p>Look at this: I send down a spy, A. Kitchener
and Co. send him back with answer. If Kitchener
and Co. thought, they would know that A., being
seen passing to and fro, must incur suspicion; however,
A. happily gets through <i>with risk</i> (not having,
by the way, had one penny from K. and Co.); then
all communication stops till I send down B. What
is K. doing at Debbeh? that he could not write
a better letter than to tell me the names of the
generals and regiments&mdash;a matter of the most
supreme indifference to Kartoum.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 25.</i>&mdash;Arabs came down to the Blue
Nile in some force, but the <i>Mansowrah</i> going up, and
our men pushing along the bank, they all fled. I
am going to Halfeyeh to see the Shaggyeh, who are
the worry of my heart. Having gone down, I
found a very fair market, and the Shaggyehs less
irritating than I expected to find them.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What was the policy of her Majesty’s
Government in sending up General Gordon?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To endeavour to retire the garrisons
<i>by quiet means</i>.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is the object of General Earle’s
expedition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> The same. General Gordon having
failed.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> If General Earle’s expedition is for
the retreat of General Gordon and ends there, what
is the result?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Her Majesty’s Government agree <i>that
they abandon the garrisons</i>.</p>

<p><i>There is no possible escape from the situation.</i></p>

<p>According to accounts from Bourré, the Arabs
had come down in some force at night, and had hid
in villages near Bourré, meaning to fall upon our
foraging parties; they did not bargain for the
<i>Mansowrah</i> coming up with her two guns, and so
caught a Tartar when they emerged to attack our
men, and went off in great confusion and some loss.</p>

<p>An escaped soldier came in from the Arabs&mdash;no
news. He was so dreadfully itchy, I could not
keep my patience, or keep him in my room. He
saw himself in the mirror, and asked who it was;
said he did not know! and really he did not seem to
know. It stands to reason that in countries where
there are no mirrors, every one must be a complete
stranger to himself, and would need an introduction.</p>

<p>I wrote to Waled a Goun, Arab commander-in-chief,
as follows:&mdash;“I went to Halfeyeh to see Shaggyeh,
found five men there; they wanted me to kill them,
for being of your family, who had gone back to you
after pretending to join me. I questioned these
five men; they said they could not bear the smell
of you, and that the Shaggyehs had wanted their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
things, and so had invented the accusation. I have
no scales to weigh the truth&mdash;perhaps Mahomet
Achmet Mahdi has&mdash;so, as you have sent me many
soldiers of late, I send you these men. I have
taken the body of your Peacock” (alluding to the
man who came in with the wonderful Dervish dress),
“but I send you the plumage of your bird on
another body.” I have put the dress on one of the
men I sent out.</p>

<p>“Why did you run away so swiftly to-day? was
Abou Gugliz there? It could not be you, for you
said so much about your desire to die at the
fortifications.”</p>

<p>“As for knowing the truth in the Soudan it is
impossible, for the devils of lying and robbery are
riding all over the country.”</p>

<p>I gave them a dollar each; they leave to-morrow.
I have also given them a captured Arab flag and a
captured Dervish cap each, so they will go out a
grand procession, and as it is their Sunday (Friday),
they will arrive at church parade.</p>

<p>Thousands of cranes, with their curious cry, are
passing over every day (“The cranes of Ibycus.”
Few ever read Schiller’s poems. I only know
Bulwer’s translation, but they have grand things in
them. “The Veiled Image of Truth at Sais,”
“The Ring of Polycrates,” for who can bear <i>plain
truth</i>? Who can bear <i>success</i>?)</p>

<p>The notables were in a regular state about my
going to Halfeyeh to-day. A deputation came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
prevent it, but it was of no use. The Mudir threw
himself down and embraced my feet, begging me
not to go; but, as I thought his solicitude was
actuated more by the wish to prevent me going to
where he has, I expect, been robbing right and left,
than my security, I did not attend much to him. I
should break the hearts of our F.O., for I say openly,
“As your Government is bad, and will give you
nothing when you are decrepit, rob away gaily, but
with wisdom, and do not let me hear of it.”</p>

<p>The Arabs will be in an awful rage to-morrow
with the procession of the five Dervishes with
captured flags, &amp;c. You can scarcely imagine the
state (well known to Stewart, Power, and Herbin)
one gets in, when one is constantly hearing explosions;
what with the guns, mines, and musketry, one’s
nerves get strained, and nothing can drop without
one thinking it is an explosion. What the Russians
underwent at Sevastopol must have been terrible.
As Hansall, the Austrian Consul, says, it is <i>abrutissant</i>.
It has slackened off now, but still any
loud noise, in this clear air, makes me jump (<i>i.e.</i>, be,
for a moment, afraid) like any man who rides knows,
when his horse, as it were, sinks completely beneath
him, on a sudden start.</p>

<p>I look forward to the advent of some of the Royal
Navy more than anything. There are such a lot of
splendid cutting-outs and surprises to be made by
the steamers, and the steamers are first-rate in
every respect. Each steamer is worth two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
men, if well handled, and they have all on board grub
and ammunition, and want no commissariat officers.</p>

<p>If I were Earle, I would leave all the principal
medical officers at Dongola, and only take on the
lowest ranks of the Army Medical Department.</p>

<p>The Principal Medical Officers are bores and
croakers, and want all sorts of attention. A man
is a fool or a physician at forty years of age. All in
this country you want is to <i>keep the communication
open</i>, and Cockle will do that. As for wounds, there
will be none, <i>for Arabs give no quarter</i>; neither
will we, I expect, if we go over one hundred miles
of desert.</p>

<p>At Halfeyeh to-day, going round the Fort, a
tallow-faced Egyptian dashed out with the most
fearful whine. I tried to calm him, no good, so
Cassim el Mousse, the Shaggyeh Meleh, interfered;
no use! the man (?) threw himself on the ground,
and deluged himself and me with dust, so Cassim
gave him a wipe over the head with his Hippo
whip, and I ordered him to be taken out of the ranks
and brought to Kartoum; <i>en route</i> my cavasses
came and remonstrated, saying he ought to be
secured, for he was the most notorious thief of
Alexandria; so, justly or not, I have put him in
prison.</p>

<p>It would be a great mistake to think the troops
are down in the mouth. We have certainly lost
a lot; but the men are as determined as ever, and
only think it their due if they are aided. Stewart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
talks of their cowardice, but it is a cowardice of
calculation, and it would be a great mistake if the
expeditionary force <i>for the extrication of the garrisons</i>
comes up here, and thinks the men are going to say
they are <i>in extremis</i>. (I leave out Cairo troops and
the Bashi Bazouks.) The black soldiers do not
think they have been beaten. There are not many
armies which would bear with the equanimity these
troops do, the loss of say one-fifth of their numbers
<i>killed</i>, which was the case in one defeat (only twenty
days ago) of Mahomet Ali Pasha.</p>

<p>The steamers from Sennaar will I think be in
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The question to-day at Halfeyeh was this. Certain
heads of families had gone over to the Arabs
with Saleh Pasha (we put a sponge over that affair),
and their adherents, being in Kartoum, had not
gone over (not their fault); those who had gone
over with Saleh Pasha, afterwards came over to me,
and asked for their adherents to be given back to
them. To this the chiefs of families, who had been
in Kartoum and who had kept these adherents
under them, objected, so it became a question what
to do. I decided to ask each man his desire.
“Will you go with A. or B.?” The men came in
at the door, and after having elected, they went
out of the window, for there were not two doors;
they elected as they wished, and went out of the
window. Some came in and thought that all that
was required of them was to come in at the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and go out of the window as quickly as possible
without answering! I do love to study mankind;
he is far better than any landscape. These fellows
knew well enough I was going to put their decision
on them, and tried to avoid giving any, as to with
whom they would go. It was somewhat of a
gymnastic process for them to go out of the
window, and they made a good mess of it; but if
I had let them go out of the door by which they
had entered, inextricable confusion would have
occurred. As it was, we had resurrections at the
door of those who had departed by the window,
which caused some bother. The two rival chiefs
were present, and one’s object was to prevent the
elector looking at either while he elected; sometimes
it was necessary to secure that the pug-face
was fairly on the clerk, the electing officer, who
asked the question A. or B. I will back the eye
for knowledge more than any other organ. A man
who does not look you in the face in answering is
99 times in 100 a liar.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 26.</i>&mdash;There is one great question, and
if you know a person, say, K. is faithless and is
seeking his own, ought one to be down on him?
We have an example in our Lord. He knew Judas
was going to betray Him, yet He did not denounce
him; from which I infer, if we know even that K.
is going to rat, or be faithless, unless he, K., gives
positive proof of such intention, we ought to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
K. as J., of whom we have no suspicion of treachery.
I am inclined (satanically I own) to distrust every one,
<i>i.e.</i>, I trust every one. I believe that circumstances
may arise when self-interest will almost compel your
nearest relative to betray you to some extent. Man
is an essentially treacherous animal; and although
the psalmist said <i>in his haste</i> “all men are liars,” I
think he might have said the same <i>at his leisure</i>.</p>

<p>“You may depend upon it, I will do my best for
you”&mdash;to chief clerk W.O. “Why, if you give it to
<i>him</i> we must give it to more than forty. It is out of
the question.” What is the result? Why the <i>him</i>
will go to his club and say, “Why I was promised
it and did not get it.” Whereas if he had weighed
the words, he would have seen he was promised
only “the best he could do.” This is a breach of
confidence, but it is an example. A man long ago
dead &mdash;&mdash; was asked by a lady to recommend her
son for an appointment &mdash;&mdash; (who was most honest),
wrote saying so-and-so wants such and such a thing,
but that he did not think the young man for whom
the appointment was solicited was worth much. &mdash;&mdash;
wrote to the lady to say he had done his best.
Unfortunately he placed the letters into wrong envelopes.
The lady never looked on &mdash;&mdash; again.
Well, I suppose &mdash;&mdash; was treacherous to the lady.
He might have refused to write, but he did more&mdash;he
did the young man <i>harm</i> by saying <i>he was not
worth much</i>.</p>

<p>I like to take things in a light-hearted way. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
like the tacit contract, “that if you are useful to me
I will use you”; and “<i>that</i>” (with full belief) “if
I cease to be useful to you you will leave me.” I
try and act, “do to others as they wish you to do
to them.” I would never put a man in any position
I would not put myself.</p>

<p>Although man is the essence of treachery, I believe
every man <i>wishes to be honest; his interests
prevent him</i>.</p>

<p>The five men went out to Arab lines with their
Arab flags, on which a church parade, which was
going on, dispersed.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that any effort to relieve the
garrisons made from the outside is contemporaneous
with the <i>expiration</i> of the period stated in March
of the time they could hold out, viz., six months.
There are some ugly suspicious circumstances all
the way through! The consequence will be a far
greater expense. Had efforts been made quietly
between March and August to span with proper
transport between Wady Halfa and Hannek,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> much
of the present difficulties to an advance would have
been got over, and security would have been felt
everywhere that efforts were really being made.
There is a humility in Baring’s telegram asking my
advice as to routes for access to Kartoum. “Sir
E. Baring having gone to London, I am charged by
Her Majesty’s Government to tell you to keep them
informed not only as to immediate but as to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
prospective danger at Kartoum, that you should
advise them in order to be prepared for any such
danger as to force necessary to secure your retreat,
its amount, character, route for access to Kartoum,
and time for its departure. Her Majesty’s Government
does not entertain your proposal to supply
you with Turkish or other forces for the purpose of
undertaking military expeditions, such being beyond
scope of your commission, and at variance with the
policy which was the purport of your mission to the
Soudan. If with this knowledge you continue at
Kartoum, you should state cause and intention with
which you so continue.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> If the telegrams I sent
down in March to Baring are referred to, it will be
seen I had already<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> informed him of all he could
possibly want to know, and I specially said that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
expedition by the route of Wady Halfa would be
(as it was at that epoch) a mere picnic party.</p>

<p>Man proposes&mdash;God disposes. Any one who two-and-a-half
years ago had said that the Gladstone
ministry would not only go to Egypt, and, not content
with one expedition to the Soudan (Graham’s),
would go in for <i>two expeditions</i>, would have been
scouted as a madman; and it certainly is curious
that Mr. Gladstone, in “&mdash;&mdash; <i>Review</i>”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of 1878,
combating Mr. Dicey’s ideas for the annexation of
Egypt, should have stated that this <i>annexation was
impossible on account of the Soudan</i>!</p>

<p>There is one thing, which, in the opinion of the
world, would expunge all disagreeables from the
whole question, <i>i.e.</i>, if the abolition of slavery were
proclaimed. It would be a difficult job, but would
be possible if we took our time, and at Lord Mayor’s
dinners, &amp;c., it would be a platform no one could
come up to.</p>

<p>4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Steamers from Sennaar in sight. Now
we shall be all together again, thank God!</p>

<p>The Arabs off the south front are all agog at sight
of the steamers coming down. Those on the Blue
Nile are firing on the steamers. I sent up <i>Mansowrah</i>
to help them. The Arabs are in the houses. Expenditure
of ammunition is enormous, I should think.
The three steamers have passed the place where
the Arabs are. They came down one by one,
which was not wise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>From the top of the Serail one commands view

<p>It will be a satisfaction to Her Majesty’s Navy to
know that it is our navy which has, humanly speaking,
saved us. It really is a splendid fleet and
naval arsenal. The steamers have come in; the
Arabs were numerous and had five guns; seven of
their shells struck the steamers (Arabs had also two
rocket tubes). The steamers brought down 2000
ardebs, and report Sennaar well off, and no Arabs
in arms in all their district. Seyd Osman Mahomet
is said to have occupied Katarif with his men. A
sheikh has promised to capture the steamer <i>Mahomet
Ali</i>, which is up the River Dinder, and to
hand her over to the Sennaar Governor. Wad
Medinet did not fire on the steamers, but brandished
spears, &amp;c.; our loss in passing the gauntlet was
three killed and eight wounded.</p>

<p>The Arabs have no conscience; they make my
captured soldiers serve the guns, and otherwise act
against us under pain of death!</p>

<p>I declare my people do, in a feeble way, what is
wanted, and do not deserve the character of
cowards; they bear defeat far better than other
peoples, and they are good-tempered over it. <i>We</i>
English are the cream, all acknowledge that, but
we will not exist on two dates a day, as these
men do, without a murmur.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Bordeen</i> was struck by two shots,
one near water-line. The <i>Ismailia</i> steamer received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
three, the <i>Talataween</i> steamer received two shots.
Happily all got down safe. The Arabs fired from
guns and rifles with fury&mdash;we could see that from
the roof. All the steamers have got small-pox
from bullet-marks! Our chief of the arsenal, Hussein
Bey, had been sharp enough to have bits of
old tents ready to stop shot-holes. Had we not
had these we might have lost the <i>Bordeen</i> steamer.</p>

<p>The Arabs had three forts (breastworks) along
the river-bank, rather above Giraffe. I mentioned
that we lost three killed and eight wounded; <i>now
mark this</i>, on their way down the steamers met
three escaped soldiers from the Arabs; they took
them on board, and, odd to say, of those killed and
wounded, were these three men, two having been
killed, and the other badly wounded! This is remarkable.
If we could believe it, <i>we are as safe in
the fiercest battle as in a drawing-room in London</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 27.</i>&mdash;I have arranged to send down
three steamers to Shendy to co-operate with
Dongola forces, and to raise the Shaggyeh tribes.
I have sent out a man to warn Dongola of this
fact. He carries no letters, only a small slip, stating
he is a “true man.”</p>

<p>It is of no use sending up to Sennaar again for
dhoora, for we have no money to pay for it, and it
is a risk with these Arab guns. Steamer <i>Ismailia</i>
received three shells; steamer <i>Bordeen</i> two; steamer
<i>Talataween</i> two. Some made tremendous holes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
one in <i>Bordeen</i> was close to water-line; it is wonderful
how they escaped. The poor escaped soldiers were
asleep in the hold, when a shell entered and burst;
two were killed, one was seriously wounded.</p>

<p>Two men came in from the Arabs. One said he
was the Mahdi, the other said a courier had come
to the Arabs, saying the English were at Berber;
they knew nothing of yesterday’s fight.</p>

<p>Our steamers are of about the same consistency as
the Thames steamboats, so you may imagine the
risk there is of putting them under artillery fire.</p>

<p><i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up the White Nile exchanging
musketry fire with the Arabs.</p>

<p>My beautiful steamers, which used to be comparatively
sweet, now stink like badgers. As for
the swell <i>Ismailia</i> she is a cess-pit.</p>

<p>Several other shots struck the upper works of the
steamers; evidently they were under a nasty fire,
and as for bullet marks they are spotted all over.
Among the three killed (two of them escaped
soldiers) one was a little boy.</p>

<p>Another slave came in at Omdurman, but had no
news.</p>

<p>Great female squawking under the window of the
Serail, approaching to yells. On examination I find
the noise comes from a black female fighting the
cavass. On enquiry I find my lady had gone down
to buy dhoora with two dollars in her hand, and had
been pushed by some ungallant fellow, and the dollars
fell into the river. Though I do not see that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
responsibility was upon me, I gave her the two dollars,
and comforted her black soul. It would be a comfort
if all the troubles of life were got rid of so cheaply.</p>

<p>Having undergone considerable anxiety owing to
the Shaggyeh tribe in our lines during the blockade,
we got rid of them to Halfeyeh as soon as we could.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
But when they got to Halfeyeh, and met their
brethren who had been with the Arabs, and who
had come over to us, the former were seized with
distrust of the latter, and so we are obliged to bring
these latter into Kartoum. I do not think it any
risk, for the Shaggyeh have lied so very much to the
Arabs that nothing would ever make peace between
them, so I do not feel any discomfort about them.</p>

<p>It is not comfortable to see your steamers with a
hole in them through which you could push your
head and shoulders, and that not a foot above the
water-line. The <i>Bordeen</i> had that, the shell came in
on one side and burst on penetrating the other
plate of the other side.</p>

<p>To my mind, these Egyptian mountain guns are
far preferable to those steel guns of ours, with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
wretched small calibre, and I would prefer a smooth
bore howitzer to an Armstrong for these wars.</p>

<p>I made Nutzer Bey a Pasha for his Sennaar trip,
and send him down with Cassim el Mousse to
Metemma to await advance of Her Majesty’s forces.
Ibraham Tongi and Mousse Beys refused, or rather
declined to go unless also made Pashas, which I did
not see, so these worthies stay here.</p>

<p>B. to A.&mdash;“Well you know I had to send on the
telegram, and I added I hoped Stewart was well.
That fellow G. takes exception to this, and says <i>va
sans dire</i>, that I could not have wished that Stewart
was ill. Most unjust. Had I added anything to
this telegram, I might have got into a row, which
would never do, but what was the use of pampering
to inordinate curiosity?”</p>

<p>A. to B.&mdash;“Well he pitched into me for asking
Stewart to tell me if I could do anything for him
(the communications being so easy), and for telling
<i>him</i> the names of the Generals (to my mind a most
important matter, for it would strike terror among
the Arabs), <i>he</i> says <i>he</i> does not care who the Generals
are (which is sheer heresy and perfectly sickening). I
shall write nothing more to <i>him</i> except the purest
official documents. It is very clear his liver is out
of order, to go and attack officers of his own corps
like that. It is atrocious!”</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 28.</i>&mdash;Two women and a man came in
to-day; they say the Mahdi is not at Schatt, but at
Rahad. Hussan Effendi and another directed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
guns against the steamers. The women say the
Arabs had three guns, not five. The Arabs did not
lose many from their people’s accounts. Among the
three guns there was a Krupp, they say.</p>

<p>Say for a moment that the object of Her Majesty’s
Government is simply to enable me to retreat, and
is irrespective of the retreat of the garrisons&mdash;then
all the loss of life in this neighbourhood on both
sides was thrown away, inasmuch as if I had not
come there would have been a speedier collapse,
without the loss of life (at least such is probable).
The Government may say that they had reasonable
hopes that I would succeed; I will neither say I gave
them such assurance or that I did not give it. I
think I was neutral in giving or in not giving such
assurance.</p>

<p>When the steamers get to Shendy, they will be
only 150 miles from Ambukol, which is a little
higher up the Nile than Debbeh (35 miles). Three
more slaves came in from the north; they had run
away from their master, and will enter the army. I
expect we shall have lots of this sort of thing.</p>

<p>Arabs show no disposition to close our road to
Shendy as yet, and I believe the country up to that
place is with <i>Kartoum</i> (I cannot say <i>the Government</i>,
for I do not know what the Government is).</p>

<p>One of the greatest sinners in the way of getting
Egypt into financial difficulties (whence all this
trouble) is ... who in the Crimea used to sell
cheeses and other things at exorbitant prices.</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Baker will be disgusted to know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the crack vessel he got from Samuda, the <i>Ismailia</i>,
the biggest of his lot, is the worst of the larger <i>fighting</i>
steamers. She is a good yacht, but nothing more.
All these steamers we owe to Sir Samuel Baker.</p>

<p>A Frenchman, Monsieur de Bizemont, brought up
the steamers from Cairo, through all the cataracts.
Monsieur le Blanc was with him. Mr. Higginbotham,
C.E., took the steamers in sections across
the Korosko desert.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 29.</i>&mdash;To-morrow is Bairam. I have
made Ferratch Pasha take over the festivities.
The <i>Talataween</i>, <i>Mansowrah</i>, and <i>Saphia</i>, (<i>D.V.</i>)
leave for Shendy to-morrow night with 100 men on
board of each. Cassim el Mousse goes with them.
I send a slip to Lord Wolseley, to be forwarded
with a spy. The two journals of events from 10th to
30th September, and map of Berber, will go with
steamers, in hopes of their being able to find a more
secure road of sending them to Debbeh or elsewhere.</p>

<p>I found we had 700 bags of Indian rice in
store. I have issued it on account of pay to the
troops, at two okes<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> per dollar. They will sell it at
three okes per dollar. It wipes off my debt to
them, and they will gain.</p>

<p>An escaped soldier came in, and says Mahdi has
had three messengers from Metemma, saying British
troops were coming up in shoals, and so he had a
dream, in which he was ordered back to Kordofan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>I hope the officers and men of Her Majesty’s
forces will be considerate to the Egyptian soldiers
and sailors; <i>they do not understand English</i>, but as
they have done some good service, I hope they will
be kindly treated. They are a trying lot, as I well
know, but if it were not for them, our soldiers would
have to tramp many a weary sandy mile. It is one
of my joys that I never have to see Great Britain
again. I hope to get out of this affair, and either
go to the Congo, <i>viâ</i> Equatorial Province, or by
Brussels. At any rate I shall never have to undergo
the worries I underwent during the week I was in
England this year. I say this in order that those
who may have to do with me may know how very
determined a man’s will must be who does not
wish (and indeed <i>will not ever</i>) go back to England
again, and to whom continuance in Her Majesty’s
Service, except for the honour of it, is a matter of
indifference.</p>

<p>I am now going to be egotistic, but it will save a
mint of trouble, and I may be pardoned, considering
the circumstances. By being so I may save myself
what I should much regret, a quarrel.</p>

<p>My idea is to induce Her Majesty’s Government
to undertake the extrication of all people or garrisons,
now hemmed in or captive, and that if this is
not their programme, then to resign my commission
and do what I can to attain it (the object). As long
as a man remains in Her Majesty’s Service he is
bound to obey the orders of his superiors, but if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
resigns he cannot be held as insubordinate if he
disobeys. Of course it may turn on the question of
whether once having entered the service of Her
Majesty’s Army, one is free to leave it at one’s will.
But we officers are not like the private soldiers
engaged for a term of years, and perhaps one
may risk dismissal if the cause is worthy of it&mdash;which,
I think, the question of abandoning the
garrisons is.</p>

<p>I say this, because I should be sorry for Lord
Wolseley to advance from Dongola without fully
knowing my views. If Her Majesty’s Government
are going to abandon the garrisons, then do not
advance. I say nothing of evacuating the country,
I merely maintain that if we do so, every one in the
Soudan, captive or hemmed in, ought to have the
option and power of retreat. Having given them
that option and power, I have nothing more to say,
and I would not care whether the country is evacuated
or not.</p>

<p>It is a miserable country, but it is joined to Egypt,
and to my idea it would be difficult to divorce the
two.</p>

<p>I will end these egotistical remarks by saying that
no persuasion will induce me to change my views;
and that as to force, it is out of the question, for
I have the people with me&mdash;at any rate of the
towns which hold out. Therefore, if Her Majesty’s
forces are not prepared to relieve the whole of the
garrisons, the General should consider whether it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
worth coming up&mdash;in his place, <i>if not so prepared</i>,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
I would not do so. I do not dictate, but I say what
every gentleman<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in Her Majesty’s Army would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
agree to&mdash;that it would be <i>mean (coûte que coûte)</i> to
leave men who (though they may not come up to
our ideas as heroes) have stuck to me, though a
<i>Christian dog in their eyes</i>, through great difficulties,
and thus force them to surrender to those who have
not conquered them, and to do that at the bidding
of a foreign Power, to save one’s own skin. Why
the black sluts would stone me if they thought I
meditated such action. Stewart knows all this and
used to groan over perversity.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>September 30.</i> The Arabs fired seven shells last
night at 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> which fell inside the lines, but did no
harm. To-day being Bairam, they fired four rounds
in their camp&mdash;a salute I suppose.</p>

<p>The spy who came in yesterday, says the report
is rife that Seyd Mahomet Osman’s men have
entered Katarif.</p>

<p>The three steamers will leave here to-day for
Shendy at 4 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<p>I shoved off the Bairam reception upon Ferratch
Pasha, who held it upon the lines. I am not up to
these affairs, and I think he likes them.</p>

<p>As soon as ever I hear of the arrival of troops at
Berber, down will go the Greeks, Bashi Bazouks,
and Fellaheen soldiers with a month’s provisions.
The people of Berber then can send them on, as
best they can&mdash;they will be off my hands. I have
everything ready to send them. We have no
telegraph wire left up here to repair the lines, so
Floyer had better see to it; all ours has been used
in the wire entanglements.</p>

<p>The troops on board the steamers are Fellaheen
soldiers. If Berber is captured, better take them out
and keep them (they are part of their way to their
homes), and replace them with such black troops as
may be released at Berber; but see after these white
soldiers’ pay, and rations, and do not neglect them.</p>

<p>We do not want to be told the steamers are
dirty, for we know it.</p>

<p>If coming up, see beforehand that Arabs have
not a gun or guns at the Shoboloha Pass, and if
wood has to be looted, loot those people on the left
bank of the Nile, <i>not</i> those on the right.</p>

<p>I do not care much to have Wood’s men here;
there will be sure to be rows between them and our
blacks, and they are not favourites in the Soudan.
Still less do I want to see Bashi Bazouks, or tribes
who have been taken into our pay, for they will rob
right and left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>I have prepared the beads, copper rods, uniforms,
&amp;c., to send up to the Equator as soon as it is possible.
Report says the garrison of the Equator is
at Fashoda.</p>

<p>The sister steamer to <i>Abbas</i> will be finished in
twelve days. We made, or rather Hassan Bey
made, a first-rate crank.</p>

<p>Remember, we have very few dollars here, and
gold is depreciated in value. We have only £1,000
in the treasury.</p>

<p>It would be as well to tell the Greek creditors,
who may be coming up, that there is not the least
probability that the Government, whatever it may
be, will look at any of their claims until at least a
year has expired.</p>

<p>We have painted the steamers up; they are
whited sepulchres.</p>

<p>I hope Ibrahim Tongi and Moussa Beys, who will
come down with the first lot, who leave this (after
the hoped-for capture of Berber), will be sent on to
Cairo at once, and not given appointments, on any
consideration, at Berber or elsewhere.</p>

<p>I like trying to find solutions for this Soudan
problem. This is the last. Let Towfik Pasha send
up Abdel Kader Pasha, as Governor-General, to
replace me at once. As soon as the Firman comes,
I am out of calculation, and Her Majesty’s Government
can do what they like, for Abdel Kader will
follow their dictum. Such an act would not in
the least vex me. Lord Wolseley can then do
what he thinks fit with respect to the Soudan, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
abandonment, and all the etceteras, and I am free
of all responsibility to the people and to the troops,
or with respect to the money affairs, dhoora, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. But in this case, it must be borne in mind, I
am not the “rescued lamb,” simply having been
sent up to perform a certain mission, <i>i.e.</i>, extrication
of garrisons. I failed, and was replaced by Abdel
Kader and a British Force. It is for them to
explain any change in their programme.</p>

<p>The same remarks, appended to the end of
Volume I, are added to this <i>in re</i> Mr. Power and
Foreign Office, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">C. G. Gordon.</span></p>

<p class="p1 reduct">30th September, 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, Kartoum.</p>

<p class="p1">I really think that as Her Majesty’s Government
and I are in such opposite camps (at least I think so)&mdash;<i>in
re</i> the <i>extrication of the garrisons</i>&mdash;it would save
a mint of trouble if Towfik Pasha were to replace me
by Abdel Kader Pasha, with whom Her Majesty’s
Government could do as they liked. At any rate, a
scandal would be avoided; and I think Abdel Kader
would be well received by all. Of course I should
have the privilege of laughing in my sleeve if, after
all, Her Majesty’s Government found they could
not get out without the establishment of <i>Turks</i> or
<i>Zubair</i>, or the <i>retention of the Soudan</i> under Egypt.
I, therefore, as an adieu, recommend this course, for
it opens a speedy exit for me without rows, and
clears me of all responsibility whatever.</p>

<p><i>October 1.</i>&mdash;Steamers left yesterday at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> for
(Berber, <i>D.V., viâ</i>) Shendy. Yesterday the steamer
<i>Towfikia</i> attacked the Arabs on the White Nile,
and killed a horse and three men. Steamer <i>Bordeen</i>
drove back the horsemen on the Blue Nile. The
Arabs attacked a village lower down the White
Nile than Halfeyeh, and were driven back by the
villagers with loss: you may believe as much as
you like of this, <i>but our vessels went out</i>, that is the
main thing.</p>

<p>The more I think of appointing Abdel Kader<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Pasha in my place, the more strongly does the
idea recommend itself, for it does away with all
difficulties, and leaves Her Majesty’s Government
perfectly free to abandon or not as it thinks fit.
Abdel Kader Pasha would be under no such obligations
as I am to the soldiers, &amp;c., of these beleaguered
places, and Her Majesty’s Government
could put it all on him if anything was said. To me
it has the selfish advantage of being free at once of
a very disagreeable and troublesome position, both
personally and publicly.</p>

<p>As for feeling at all vexed at this arrangement,
viz. my being put out, I should not, for the only
thing which actuates me is this: <i>I think it mean to
leave the garrisons</i>; but if my superiors decide to do
so, and will take the responsibility, then what am I?
to dispute their decision, the more especially as I
cannot do so without funds, which I have not. I do
not dispute but that the withdrawal of the garrisons
is not a difficult task, but not impossible; and if not
impossible, our honour binds us to fulfil it, and to
my mind it is shabby not to do it: but Governments
do shabby things, <i>vide</i> the Boer business, and
if they are going to do it here, the way I have
pointed out is the best. There is not the least
reason for me to participate in its execution, it
would not be fair to try and force me, and another
thing is that I would <i>not</i> be forced. I believe Her
Majesty’s Government will adopt this idea, and if
they do, I see a vista of an escape with honour and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
without <i>fracas</i> (which is very pleasing), from a position
which is not likely to be a feather-bed, and
which might require me to go on struggling for
over a year, not only against the Arabs, but against
the antipathies and ill-disguised hostility of Her
Majesty’s Government, for certainly they would not
be over friendly if forced into a line of action their
soul abhors.</p>

<p><i>I think</i> we are bound to extricate the garrisons
whatever it costs; <i>they do not</i>; there is no reason
for any difference of opinion which cannot exist
between a Government and an individual, they
simply place an individual who thinks with them,
and the matter is done, and this individual is Abdel
Kader Pasha. I see no reason to try and force me
to do what I do not think right, and which I can
consequently do only in a half-hearted manner if I
even undertook it, <i>which I will not</i>.</p>

<p>As for the effect of my replacement by Abdel
Kader Pasha: 1st, it would produce no surprise, for
it is well known I and Towfik are not at all friends.
2nd, it is also known that Her Majesty’s Government
wish to be rid of all responsibility of the
Soudan, <i>in re</i> the garrisons; therefore the removal
of me would be merely the carrying out of
this policy. 3rd, Abdel Kader Pasha is the best
man they have had up here, and so, till the matter
was broken to them, he would be well received. It
is not vaunting myself when I say that the general
opinion here is this, that Her Majesty’s Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
would never have sent an expedition up here
had it not had me and Stewart here, <i>sent up by
them!</i><a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> I think they fully realise, that as far as the
garrisons, &amp;c., &amp;c., were concerned, were it not for
us they might perish as quickly as they liked;
they also realise that, unless for the action of Her
Majesty’s Government at Cairo, assistance would
have been sent long ago from Cairo, so it must not
be expected of the people to be very grateful.
They are glad to get out of their mess, but consider
they are only extricated under compulsion of circumstances,
and not <i>con amore</i>.</p>

<p>If time presses, then telegraph Towfik to make
the Mudir of Dongola <i>Governor-General</i> (it does
not signify who is your dummy, only perhaps he
may not be so ductile as Abdel Kader) in my
place, and your work is easy, such work as it is.</p>

<p><i>Personally</i>, I can assure you, I shall be only too
delighted, for I could be in Brussels in December,
and free, honourably, of the whole affair; you could
not possibly expect me to stay after being replaced.
<i>Mark my words, if you have made up your mind, this
is the best solution</i> and avoids all scandal.</p>

<p>Abdel Kader will make out that the Mahdi’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
government is not really so bad: that it is impossible,
&amp;c., &amp;c., to be wandering all over Africa, and his
paper on the state of affairs will go down splendidly
with the public, and there will be honours all round,
and mutual congratulations. The British public
accepted, without hesitation, the trial of Arabi
Pasha, by Ismail Pasha Ayoub, and Réouf Pasha,
<i>as being a just one</i>! Why, had they tried an angel,
and Towfik had wished the angel <i>guilty&mdash;guilty that
angel would have been</i>, even if Michael or Gabriel.
Now I have told you how to whitewash I will end
this tirade. I will only remark that Her Majesty’s
Government must not say <i>I was replaced, because
I wished to keep the Soudan</i>, <span class="smcap">for I do not say so</span>, it
is an useless country; what I say is, that it is
shabby <i>to abandon the garrisons</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I own the proposition I make is in some degree
a trap, for I feel confident that there will be no end
of trouble, even in placing Abdel Kader Pasha in my
place and trying to evacuate; but if you accept it you
will do so (after this warning) with your eyes open.</p>

<p>Two women slaves came in from the Sheikh el
Obeyed; no news, except that the Arabs with this
chief, are very badly off for water.</p>

<p>The following is what I would do, if in supreme
command, military and political. Divide the forces
into three sections; one, A, to stay at Dongola,
half force, and look after communications from
Wady Halfa to Berber by river, in those <i>étapes</i> or
stages already alluded to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Another, B, to occupy Berber, quarter force.</p>

<p>Another, C, to be a fighting force (quarter force)
without artillery, for we have guns up here. With
C I would come to Kartoum, coax Arabs down to
Giraffe, destroy them, then coax Arabs to El foun
and destroy them; then push up to Wad el Medinet
and destroy Arabs there, thus opening the road to
Sennaar and allowing grain to come down.</p>

</div>

<p>By which time you would see your way as to the
future. I would restore the telegraph as I went along.</p>

<p>The result of these operations would be the
retreat of the Mahdi’s Arabs to Kordofan, and the
surrender of those in and about Kassala.</p>

<p>Humanly speaking, there will be probably <i>three</i>
fights, costing each fight, <i>eight</i> killed and <i>fifteen</i>
wounded, as far as experience goes; not more, and
very likely, if the first fight is a good one (and we
have a <i>good</i> pursuit), there will be no more after
it; all the rest will be child’s play.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Arabs must have one good defeat, to wipe out
Hicks’ disasters, and <i>my defeats</i>. Berber will be
evacuated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-197.jpg" width="400" height="530"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The troops at fight No. 1 <i>Giraffe</i> will go up in the
castellated barges (which are real fortresses), and be
covered by five steamers, each with two guns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
two barges with a Krupp gun in each (16-pounders),
so there would be no risk; none of the Arabs’ forts
are closed at gorge.</p>

<p>Force need not be more than 1000 strong, <i>for we
could send</i> 3000 for the flanks; but, as it would fight
on river banks, there would be no fear for flank
attack. All could be done in thirty days as far as
fighting is concerned. This of course leaves the
question of Kordofan unsettled. The Mahdi might
come to terms, and abandon his spiritual power, but
I doubt it.</p>

<div class="floatleft">
     <img src="images/ill-198.jpg" width="150" height="164"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The fighting force C probably will be under
Buller. <i>Earle</i> at <i>Berber</i>; <i>Dormer</i> at <i>Abou Hamed</i>;
and <i>Fremantle</i> at <i>Dongola</i>; the Sirdar at <i>Wady
Halfa</i>; Lord Wolseley <span class="smcap">partout</span>! Goodenough in
command of Royal Artillery; Harrison (in recollection
of China) commanding Royal Engineers. I
hope Goodenough will not be too proud to use our
guns, he will be horrified at the vents, which are
from continuous firing; we do not rebouch
up here, not having bouches.</p>

<p>No one could be astonished at my
reluctance to make a bolt of it without
the garrisons, for it virtually makes out
all our toils, for the last seven months, as utterly
useless; we had, to all intents and purposes, better
have surrendered months ago. One feels such a
mean brute to go egging on men to fight, and then
to let it end with a skedaddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 2nd.</i>&mdash;A sergeant-major, with a soldier,
escaped last night; he reports that the Mahdi came
from Obeyed to Schatt, with two ortas of black
captured troops, two Krupp guns, and seven mountain
guns; but then the Arab tribes in his rear rose,
and that he went back, taking the guns with him,
sending one of his Ameers, Abdullah Waled Jubira, to
Kalakla with 100 black troops. The sergeant-major
reports the Arabs have 140 Krupp shells and 200
boxes of Remington ammunition; that the Arabs
did not suffer when they fired on the steamers
coming from Sennaar; that, with the Mahdi, are all
the Roman Catholic Mission party, <i>who have not
changed their religion</i>: one nun is exposed to the sun
to force her to do so. The man says the other guns
are all broken in their carriages, in the Mahdi’s fights
with the Arabs. The Mahdi takes Slatin and all
the Europeans with him when he moves; he reports
Waled a Goun has sent the black troops he had
with him to the rear, because so many escaped;
the Arabs fired a salute of four guns on arrival of
the Ameer Abdullah Waled Jubira.</p>

<p>A slave coming in from the left bank reports Faki
Mustapha with few troops; says the rumour of the
advance expeditionary force is rife; says the Arab
ferry is at Kalakla; they pass only at night. The
sergeant-major says that he is sure the tribes (on
the Mahdi’s going to Schatt) all rose and pillaged
on the road: hence the Mahdi’s return towards
Obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The man the doctor operated upon for the large
stone is dead.</p>

<p>From what the sergeant-major says, it appears I
am not more liked by the Mahdi than I am <i>elsewhere</i>&mdash;a
nuisance! and a bore!</p>

<p>The <i>Towfikia</i> steamer went up the <i>White</i> Nile,
and fired upon the Arabs! The <i>Bordeen</i> steamer
went up the <i>Blue</i> Nile, and fired upon the Arabs!
The Halfeyeh people went out and captured a
camel! All these things are <i>hostilities</i> not countenanced
by Her Majesty’s Government. This afflicts
me, that joker Egerton!</p>

<p>I have sent off another spy to Debbeh, saying
that three steamers wait their orders at Metemma,
<i>one hundred and fifty</i> miles from Debbeh!</p>

<p>The Shaggyeh tribes are giving me bother again
with their horrid families down river. They are
most exasperating.</p>

<p>A horse escaped from the Arabs, formerly belonging
to Government. It gave <i>no</i> information;
but from its action, may be supposed <i>not to believe
in the Mahdi</i>.</p>

<p>Simmons<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and I agree on one subject&mdash;that Egypt
is useless to us, unless we have command of the
seas; and if we have command of seas, Egypt is
ours; therefore it is not worth bothering about. We
will never be liked by its peoples; we do not go
the right way to be liked. To my mind, if we
looked after the Cape and Mauritius, &amp;c., it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
far more beneficial, and less expensive, than wasting
our money on Egypt and the Soudan; but because
Egypt <i>used to</i> be important, we think it is always
so. Whereas, the introduction of steam has quite
altered its importance, while the creation of other
Naval Powers in the Mediterranean renders that
sea no longer a question of supremacy of France or
England.</p>

<p>I have mentioned reports of troops moving on
Kassala, yet not one word is said, either one way or
another, by Kitchener. Surely he must know that
if this is the case, I ought to be told; or if no movement
is being made in that direction, I ought to be
informed.</p>

<p>Arabi’s clerk, Ahmet-Eff-Awaan<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> (Stewart knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
him well) was, on Stewart’s departure, represented
to me as in utter misery, so I gave him back £10
a month. <i>To-night</i> I heard my friend had been
positively preaching for the Mahdi! so I have shut
him up. An attempt was made the day before
yesterday morning to set fire to one of the houses
near the magazine at the Roman Catholic Mission.
It was discovered; it was evidently the work of an
incendiary. I have ordered all houses to be pulled
down in the neighbourhood. This is not comfortable,
for it shows we have some evil-disposed
people here.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<p><i>October 3.</i>&mdash;Small church parade to-day on South
Front. Some twenty-five horsemen came near the
lines, and four shots were fired at them.</p>

<p>An inquiry is going on about the fire near the
magazine. Some little suspicion that Awaan is
mixed up with it, for his house was near; indeed,
it adjoins the place where the fire was. It burned
four tents. It will go hard with him if he is found
guilty: certainly his preaching in favour of the
Mahdi is against him.</p>

<p>I visited the place of the fire, and also Awaan’s
house. My impression is against Awaan’s being the
culprit; but I have no doubt the Court of Inquiry
will find him guilty. Wilfred Blunt will be crying
out about this ill-used martyr, so will Arabi the
blest. I am paying for the houses pulled down.
There is no doubt the fire was the work of an
incendiary. To-day ends the Bairam.</p>

<p>Stewart will not believe it of Awaan; but it
appears that in disputing about the Mahdi, Awaan
took off his slipper<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and struck his opponent&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was so strong in his opinion. A more fawning,
wretched fellow one never saw. I should send
him to the Mahdi, but that he knows English, and
is a born intriguer.</p>

<p>I reason thus, respecting the slackness of
the Intelligence Department not sending in spies.
As noted in the Journal, on an average four or five
men come in daily from the Arabs, therefore they do
not keep so very strict a look-out; also now there
are vast gaps in their lines around the place, and one
may say from here to Shendy is open. It is more
difficult to go out than to come in, for in going out
one may stumble on some new emplacement of the
Arabs, while in coming in a man can ascertain such
emplacements beforehand; it is evident also, that as
all the information we have had has come from my
<i>return spies</i>, that no effort has been made by the
Intelligence Department. Had that Department
initiated any such step, in any energy, it is unlikely
that all <i>their</i> men would have been stopped&mdash;my
spies get caught, though, <i>so frequently</i> passing the
lines of Arabs.</p>

<p>The more one thinks of it, the more impossible
does it seem for Her Majesty’s Government to get
out of this country without extricating the garrisons
and establishing some Government at Kartoum;
once having, as they have, come up to Dongola, they
cannot well go back from Dongola, they must come
to Berber, and when once at Berber, as there is the
river, they must come up here; once here, they
must go to Sennaar or arrange to open this route.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
It is of all things the most perplexing, and one does
not see the end of it, unless we give the country to
the Turks. With the best will and with all favourable
circumstances, <i>i.e.</i>, that it is found possible to
abandon, it will take six to eight months, and with a
terrible outlay, and one cannot think that even then
it is a satisfactory termination if, after extricating the
garrisons and contenting ourselves with that, we
let the Mahdi come down and boast of driving us
out.</p>

<p>If we proclaim the abolition of slave-holding we
must proclaim it in Egypt as well, and then the
revenue falls. The Turks really seem the only way
out of it, in a speedy way. It would be cheaper
to give them a million pounds than to keep our
people up here, and there is no discredit to our
arms if we take Berber and open the route to
Sennaar, and then leave the country to the Turks,
letting them deal with the Mahdi as they like.
I think even the gift of two millions to the Turks
would be a cheap solution of it, and is also a quick
and an honourable one.</p>

<p>As for Her Majesty’s Government keeping the
Soudan itself, it is out of the question, for you could
not get men to serve here except under great
salaries and supported with large forces; and as
for giving it back to Egypt, in a couple of years we
would have another Mahdi; therefore, our choice lies
between Zubair and the Turks. Now, the time
has gone by when Zubair, almost alone, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
suffice; he would now need aid in men, while the
Turks would need no aid from us in men. Therefore,
give the country to the Turks, when once
you have come to Kartoum, with one or two
millions sterling (which YOU will spend in three
months’ occupation up here if you delay), make
arrangements at once with the Porte for its Soudan
cession, let 6,000 Turks land at Suakin and march
up to Berber, thence to Kartoum; you can then
retire at once before the hot weather comes on.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Let 3000 Turks land at Massowah and go to
Kassala; that saves you that journey. You would
be even saved waiting till the troops came from
the Equator and Bahr Gazelle.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>28th October.</i>&mdash;Berber occupied.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>5th November.</i>&mdash;1000 Troops at Kartoum. 6000
Turks land at Suakin and march to Berber. 4000
Turks land at Massowah and march to Kassala.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>8th November.</i>&mdash;Defeat of Arabs on south lines&mdash;unless
they have bolted.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>12th November.</i>&mdash;Defeat Arabs near El foun,
unless they have submitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>15th November.</i>&mdash;Despatch of force to Sennaar to
clear country round Medinet.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>1st to 10th December.</i>&mdash;Arrival of Turks at Berber
and Kartoum, and at Kassala.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>20th December.</i>&mdash;Return of Her Majesty’s forces
to Wady Halfa, leaving 1000 men at Dongola till
Turks could come from Berber.</p>

<p>The frontier to be Wady Halfa. All steamers,
&amp;c., to be handed over to the Turks. The two
millions to be paid in four instalments.</p>

<p>Suakin and Massowah to be free ports under the
Turks.</p>

<p>Egypt is responsible for the pensions of those
who return to Egypt. Turkey is responsible for the
pensions of those who stay in the Soudan. I see
nothing to prevent the whole affair being settled by
the end of January, and the whole expeditionary
force from being in Cairo at the end of February.</p>

<p>As for the slave-trade, one cannot help it.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot see why France could object if we let
her have some “say” in Egypt. She will thwart
all we do there unless we do let her have a “say.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>We make up with Turkey by this action, and she
would aid us to prevent Egypt being annexed by
any other Power.</p>

<p>Remember we have no time to lose&mdash;that we
must make our choice at once&mdash;and that choice
must be one of a strong decisive kind, with no
shifting hopes of something turning up. Our
expedition is very ticklish, very expensive, and
<i>utterly unremunerative</i>.</p>

<p>If once our men get sickly up here, and our
programme is a skedaddle, the consequences might
be most disastrous. The skedaddle programme
would cool all the people against us, and strengthen
the Mahdi immensely; and then there is no way to
avoid the heats, unless by the skedaddle programme;
but if you agree with the Turks, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
avoid the heats and the skedaddle programme,
and have people with you.</p>

<p>I hope I am not going down to History as being
the cause of this expedition, for I decline the
imputation. <i>The expedition comes up to deliver the
garrisons.</i><a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> I think it would read well in history:
“Her Majesty’s Government having accepted duties
in Egypt, and consequently in the Soudan, sent up
a force to restore tranquillity, which, having been
done, Her Majesty’s Government handed over that
government of the Soudan to the Sultan.”</p>

<p>Our people may try as they like, they can never
govern Egypt and pay the interest; combine with
France, and let down the interest to 3 per cent.,
which we cannot do without France agreeing.</p>

<p>As for any of the men in Cairo now pretending to
govern, it is useless; they know nothing of, and
have no sympathy with, the country. What can
they know of the country, sitting at Cairo? What
the people want, is half taxes, and Censors going
through provinces remedying evils. Do away with
Wood’s army, an useless expense. Do away
with three-fourths of European employés, railway,
&amp;c., &amp;c.&mdash;cormorants!&mdash;ditto Gendarmerie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall send out three men in different directions
to-morrow to Debbeh, with further notifications that
three steamers, and each with two field-guns, are at
Metemma, Shendy, 150 miles from Ambukol, which
is 35 miles higher up river than Debbeh, waiting
orders of expeditionary force, and saying Cuzzi’s
baggage is to be searched. I have now done all
I can. In ten days’ time I shall send a steamer to
Metemma with further information. The attempt
to fire the magazine has made me vicious with the
people. No one in from Arabs to-day. Query,
<i>ominous</i>!</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 4.</i>&mdash;The boiler will be put in the new
steamer (sister to <i>Abbas</i>) to-day. She will be ready
for sea in six days.</p>

<p>Report from Cassim el Mousse late last night.
Arabs say Sheikh el Obeyed meditates an attack
on Halfeyeh. The trouble these Shaggyeh have
given us is beyond description.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Bey Ruckdi, loq. Lutraim: “He called
for me at (9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) 3! in the night; he bullied me to
work. Can you imagine such a thing?&mdash;it is preposterous.
He flew at me like a tiger, because
I showed he was unreasonable. It is <i>Bairam</i> too:
can you imagine such a thing?”</p>

<p><i>Awaan</i>, Arabi’s clerk, has been telling, in the
town, that the letters I got saying, “Her Majesty’s
troops are advancing,” were written by him and
sent down, and then returned. There is an evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
wish to take off his head; but I think he is more fool
than knave, and shall try and resist the wish of town.</p>

<p>Saleh Pasha’s son telegraphed to me he wanted
to come and see me. I answered he might come or
<i>go</i>, as he liked. He said, what did I mean by
“go?” I was much tempted to say, “<i>Go to your
father, who is in chains with Mahdi</i>,” but resisted
temptation, and said, “<i>Go out of telegraph station</i>.”</p>

<p>I had to send down ten barges for those creatures
at 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> last night. (See p. 185.)</p>

<p>No spies in this morning; people will begin to
believe Awaan’s statement, that he it was who
wrote the letters (I pretended to have had) from
the English.</p>

<p>A woman just in says there is a report with the
Arabs that the English are at Dongola; that a
steamer and four nuggars, with English, are at
Berber(?) (I expect she has mixed up Stewart’s
steamer and boats with her story); that the Arab
chief of Berber has sent for help, which has not yet
been sent him.</p>

<p>One of those large shells was blown up by a boy
treading on it; it does not appear to have hurt him;
it was in the group of date palms opposite to the
Palace.</p>

<p>I confess the shells do not seem so very destructive.
Perhaps they are too deeply buried; however,
they have frightened people.</p>

<p>A small boy and five men escaped from the Arabs
and came in. The Mahdi, with Europeans, is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Schatt; he means to come to Omdurman. They
corroborate that some troops went back to Obeyed
to put down the rising of tribes.</p>

<p>The boiler has been successfully put in the small
steamer.</p>

<p>It is odd how quick the blacks, by instinct, know
how to avoid the effects of the shells, by throwing
themselves on the ground when they hear the fizz
of the quick-match; they all do it, and thus have
escaped. Of course it would not do in an assault.
The little black chap never ran so fast as he did
when he got up after the explosion, never looking
behind him. He went to two black sluts, who had
been alarmed at the noise, and explained the
opening of the ground, &amp;c., with a good deal of
gesticulation. They had a sort of Medgliss<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> on
the subject whether it was not time to return home,
and pick no more grass, after such dreadful things
had happened, and which ended in their doing so,
carefully avoiding the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>I expect these improvident people killed over
1000 sheep and goats at their Bairam; the report is
that it exceeds that number.</p>

<p>There is no doubt there will be a fearful famine
in this country next year, for there are vast districts
lying desert which were formerly cultivated.</p>

<p>The party which went to Jaila, the village north
of Halfeyeh which the Arabs had attacked, have
come back with the rescued families, and twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
cows captured from the so-called rebels.
(Query, Who are the rebels, <i>we or the Arabs</i>?)
(To-day is the 206th day we have been more or less
shut up. Delightful life! I wonder what Azotus
[Ashdod] felt with its twenty-nine years blockade?)</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 5.</i>&mdash;Two men and a boy came in from
the Arabs, and report that the Mahdi has made a
small advance towards Omdurman. Little else of
import. They say Hussein Pasha Khalifa, Saleh
Pasha, Slatin, and all the Europeans are with the
Mahdi; that Kordofan is in turmoil; that the Arabs
say they will wait till they can collect a lot of men,
and then will attack the lines.</p>

<p>If you do not arrange with the Turks you will
not get out of the country for a year, and it will
cost you twelve millions, and probably then you
will have to fall back on the Turks.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Whereas if
you arrange with the Turks you can get out in
January, and it will cost you seven millions, including
the two millions you give the Turks. Truly
this black sister “Soudan” has avenged her white
sister “Egypt.”</p>

<p>A scorpion in bath sponge this morning. It
stung me upon the finger. I murdered it, and so
am quits. I wonder whether any analysis has been
made of the scorpion’s and the cobra’s poison. This
is the sixth time I have been stung.</p>

<p>A sheikh of the neighbourhood came in, and says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a short time ago a Frenchman came up with two
Arabs from Dongola to the Mahdi. The Mahdi
could not make it out, and asked why he came.
The man said he had come up to salute the
Mahdi. The Mahdi being suspicious imprisoned
him for seven days, and then let him out. He was
in a Dervish dress. It is said he spoke to Saleh
Pasha and to Slatin in secret, upon which the
Mahdi separated these two, and put them in open
arrest (is this Rochefort?) My informant says he
denied to the Mahdi that the English were in
Dongola, but told Slatin and Saleh Pasha that they
were there. This man is with the Mahdi now, and
is free. It might be Renan,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the author of the ‘Life
of Jesus,’ who in his last publication takes leave of
the world, and is said to have gone into Africa, not
to reappear again. He was a Roman Catholic
priest originally, is a great Arabic scholar, and
evidently a very unhappy and restless man.</p>

<p>I met him once in the rooms of the Royal Geographical
Society one afternoon, and I remember
the Secretary proposing to him to go up to the <i>top</i>
of that <i>high house!</i> to see the observatory. Renan
declined. He looked bored and weary in being
made a hero of, and when Sir R. Alcock introduced
me to him, I suppose he saw my look of commiseration
for his trials, and was civil to me.
I have often thought we might meet again. What
a fearful infliction hero-worship is to its victim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
I think it a great impertinence to praise a man to
his face. It implies you are his superior, for the
greater praises the smaller; and though that may
be the case, it is not necessary to announce it to the
smaller. Supposing one is wrinkled and grey-haired,
it is satire to say you are smooth-skinned,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and beautiful, and so it must be with every
man who knows himself and who is praised&mdash;endurance,
self-denial, and twaddle&mdash;one would have
bolted like a lamplighter if one could, and one
could have stood the after criticism.</p>

<p>... on going to the trenches before Sevastopol
fell out, and said he would not go down. The
colonel put him under arrest. He was in a way
more plucky to do this than to go to the trenches.
Self-sacrifice is that of a nurse&mdash;ignored (and “paid,”
of course, what can she want more!). No one goes
into ecstasies over her self-denial.</p>

<p>If it is Renan he will not approve of the pepper
system. The man says the Mahdi was perfectly
astounded at this Frenchman’s appearance, and did
nothing but question him. “Why do you come
here?” &amp;c., &amp;c. If he comes to the lines, and it is
Renan, I shall go and see him, for, whatever one
may think of his unbelief in our Lord, he certainly
dared to say what he thought, and he has not
changed his creed to save his life.</p>

<p>A black mother and her two sons have come in,
and say the Mahdi is at Jura Hadra, twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
miles south of Duem. The woman was delighted
to see herself in the mirrors, and grinned and
smirked at her reflections.</p>

<p>Spies say Nuehr Bey Angara has been sent back
by the Mahdi to Obeyed, to put down the rising of
the tribes; if he would only <i>rise</i> himself, for he is an
old friend of mine, the Mahdi would be cut off from
Obeyed and be in a bad way.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Bordeen</i> is back from Halfeyeh.</p>

<p>We chose to regard Greece, Spain, Turkey,
Mexico, and other lands, as debtors and bankrupts.
We did not attempt to saddle the rulers, personally,
with the debts of these countries&mdash;excepting in the
case of Egypt and Ismail Pasha (<i>i.e.</i>, we did not
turn out the rulers of those states, while we did
turn out Ismail), of course it is easy to put it down
to his ill-faith. I expect the rulers of those other
states were guilty of far worse faith.  It is the
custom to <i>say</i> we acted in the interests of the
oppressed fellaheen, but what have the fellaheen
gained up to the present time? Where are those
millions to come from I have talked of?</p>

<p>Let us consider dispassionately the state of affairs.
Does Her Majesty’s Government consider they are
responsible for the extrication of the Soudan
garrisons and Cairo inhabitants? We can only
judge that Her Majesty’s Government does recognise
this responsibility, for otherwise why did they
send me up, and why did they relieve Tokar?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Once this responsibility is assumed, I see no outlet
for it but to relieve the garrisons, <i>coûte que coûte</i>.
It may be said that the object of the present
expedition is for <i>my</i> relief <i>personally</i>. But how is
it possible for me to go away and leave men whom I
have egged on to fight for the last six months?
How could I leave after encouraging Sennaar to
hold out? No one could possibly wish me to do
so. No Government could take the responsibility
of so ordering me. There is this difficulty: perhaps
it would be patriotic to bolt; but <i>even if</i> I could get
<i>my mind</i> to do it, I doubt if it is possible to get <i>my
body</i> out of this place. Had Baring said in March,
“Shift for yourself as best you can,” which he could
have done, the affair could have been arranged, and
we could have bolted to the Equator; but, if you
look over my telegrams,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> you will see I ask him what
he will do, and he never answered.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
had not then endured any privation, and I was, as
it were, not much engaged to them; but now it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
different, especially as we have communicated with
Sennaar.</p>

<p>No one can judge the waste of money and
expense of life in the present expedition&mdash;it is an
utter waste of both&mdash;but it is simply due to the
indecisions of our Government. Had they said
from the first, “We do not care&mdash;we will do nothing
for the garrisons of the Soudan, they may perish; had
they not relieved Tokar; had they not telegraphed
to me as to the force to relieve me (<i>vide</i> telegrams,
5th May, from Suakin; 29th April, from Massowah).
Had they telegraphed (when Baring telegraphed to
Cuzzi 29th March, which arrived here saying,
‘No British troops are coming to Berber, negotiations
going on about opening road&mdash;Graham was
about to attack Osman Digna’”), “<i>SHIFT FOR
YOURSELF</i>”, why, nothing could have been said;
but Her Majesty’s Government would not say they
were going to abandon the garrisons, and therefore
“<i>shift for yourself</i>”. It is that which has hampered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
us so much. On the one hand, if I bolted I deserted
them (Her Majesty’s Government); on the other
hand, by staying I have brought about this expedition.
Baring gave me distinct orders not to go to
the Equator without the permission of Her Majesty’s
Government (<i>vide</i> telegrams with Stewart’s journal).<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
I do not question the policy of Her Majesty’s
Government in not keeping the Soudan. It is a
wretched country, and not worth keeping. I do not
pretend even to judge the policy of letting the
garrisons, &amp;c., &amp;c., perish; but I do say, I think that
Her Majesty’s Government ought to have taken
the bold step of speaking out and saying, <i>“SHIFT
FOR YOURSELF” in March</i>, when I could
have done so, and not now, when I am in honour
bound to the people after six months’ bothering
warfare. Not only did Baring not say, “<i>Shift for
yourself</i>,” but he put a veto upon my going to the
Equator&mdash;<i>vide</i> his telegrams in Stewart’s Journal.
I say this because no one deplores more the waste
of money and life in this expedition, and no one
can realise its difficulties better than myself, but,
owing to what has past, owing to indecision, we
are in for it, and the only thing now to do is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
see how to get out of it, with honour and the least
expense possible&mdash;and I see no other way than by
giving the country to the Turks. I am not raising
difficulties, or being cantankerous; I wish most
sincerely I was out of the place, where from
February I have had no peace. The question is
how to do so. I may be wrong, but I have a
strong suspicion that much rejoicing (<i>rejoicing</i> perhaps
a <i>little</i> for my personal, but a good deal for
my official safety) would have taken place in official
circles had I appeared in the <i>Abbas</i> with Stewart;
but it was not even physically possible, and I should
have been a disgraced man for ever had I been
able to do so and had done it. Besides which, we
were entirely in doubt as to the intentions of Her
Majesty’s Government as to letting the garrisons
slide or not. I might have been tried for deserting
my post, and for letting the steamers and stores fall
into the hands of the Mahdi, for that was certain
within five days of my quitting the place. What I
suspect or do not suspect, would not justify me in my
action, and, as it turns out, my suspicions were wrong,
for after Stewart left, I hear a British force is coming
up&mdash;of course it is a query what is it coming up
for? If <i>for the garrisons</i>, then I have done what
the Government wants, for I have kept the city; if
<i>for me</i>, then I have done wrong, for I should have
come down at all costs; but in one case great
inconvenience would have been given; while in
the other it is only my life&mdash;and if it is <i>for me</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
expedition comes, it would be better to tell me,
“Shift for yourself; we do not mean to extricate the
garrisons”&mdash;in which case perhaps we may find an
issue&mdash;at any rate the people will know exactly the
state of affairs, and our Government will not be
exposed to an unnecessary expense and danger in
sending troops up here for <i>ME</i>. I should consider
Her Majesty’s Government were completely exonerated
from all responsibility with respect to myself
if they sent me that order, “<i>Shift for yourself</i>; we
<i>do not mean to extricate the garrisons</i>,” I should
make my arrangements, and (telling the people how
I am situated, with no hope of relief for them),
should make a bolt to the Equator in six weeks’
time. There would be no dishonour in that, for, as
I had no relief coming, the only sequel of my staying
with them would be to be a prisoner with them, and
in fact my presence would only exasperate the Arabs
instead of being of any good.</p>

<p>It may be argued, Why not retreat on Berber?
I would rather not do that, for I would wish to
show in a positive way that I had no part or lot
in the abandoning of the garrisons, &amp;c., &amp;c., and,
at any rate, I should save the garrisons of the
Equator and of the Bahr Gazelle if I succeeded in
getting away to them.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 6.</i>&mdash;The steamer <i>Bordeen</i> up the <i>Blue</i>
Nile wasting a lot of ammunition on the Arab
foraging parties. No arsenals could stand this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
drain on their resources.  I expect that the
<i>Bordeen</i> fired fifty rounds to-day.</p>

<p>Three escaped soldiers came in from the Arabs;
they say that the Arabs have sent a Krupp and a
mountain gun to Giraffe; so that may account for the
heavy firing above mentioned. One of the men says
the Arabs placed two boats in a position close to
the two guns they had brought, in order to entice
the steamer to go and take them, thus hoping to
sink her. However, I am glad to say the steamer
is on her way back. The continual anxiety one is in
about these little things is very wearing. One never
knows if, through some rash act, I may not lose a
steamer, or men may not be cut off. One has no
man like Gessi<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> who one can trust for these little
expeditions. Steamer <i>Towfikia</i> went up the White
Nile and fired upon the Arabs. It is just as I
thought: the <i>Bordeen</i> steamer has come back,
having been struck by a shell about a foot above
the water-line, close to the cutwater; no one was
hurt. All the Arabs are going from the White
Nile towards Giraffe. I expect we shall have the
old game at Bourré again. In these circumstances
you can imagine how very vicious one feels towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Her Majesty’s Intelligence Department for not
giving us any news. It is not so much for myself
as it is for the townspeople.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The steamer reports that the Arabs had five
guns. It is evident the Arabs mean to hold the
Blue Nile by their force at Giraffe, and I dare not
try to dislodge them; they will then communicate
with the Sheikh el Obeyed’s force, and eventually
come down upon Shoboloha or thereabouts; while
the Mahdi, coming to Omdurman, will circle us in, a
second time.</p>

<p>Owing to a discovered intrigue and the risk of
having too much power in the hands of one man, I
have sent Ibrahim Ruckdi to Malia as chief clerk,
and Gugliz Bey of Malia is made my chief clerk.
Nothing like change of air for these fellows.</p>

<p>As interesting to Stewart, I will mention the
intrigue. He knows of the letters which came,
accusing Ibrahim Ruckdi of venality. Well, a
Medgliss was held, and Mahomet Bey Agad was
found guilty of sending the letters. I did not care
to push the matter, for, in my belief, Agad was
right in his accusation, although he had no right to
write anonymously. <i>Of course</i> the Medgliss found
him guilty, as every Egyptian Medgliss does every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
one sent before it; so I temporised and hinted to a
third person that it would be well if Ibrahim asked
pardon of Agad; this hint, being of course a sort
of order, he took; but I noticed he was working
against Agad; and yesterday he came with a paper
against Hassan Agad the Sandjak, putting it forward
as Ferratch Pasha’s idea to turn Hassan
Agad out. I thought over it, and it worried me,
the viciousness of the man; but I took no action.
However, to-day, as I told him to write another
order about the troops saluting me by stopping in
the road and saying he was responsible for it, he
said, as he turned away, in an impertinent manner,
“Am I Commandant of troops?” He was brought
back, and, nose to grindstone, was sent to Malia,
and Gugliz Bey was brought up to chief clerkship.</p>

<p>I own I am suspicious, <i>i.e.</i>, I judge by the eye,
by little signs, &amp;c., for I do not know the language;
but I cannot help thinking I am more often right
than wrong with my suspicions. One comes on a
group of clerks, heads all together, in the chief
clerk’s room; one sees disturbed countenances at
once. I cannot help thinking “You are concocting
devilry!” and I look out for some “<i>tricks</i>.”</p>

<p>Another soldier escaped here from the Arabs,
and says the Mahdi is at Jura Hadra, and intends
coming to Omdurman. He does not appear to think
the Arabs care for the English advance, though
they know they are at Dongola, “a far cry,” they
say, to Kartoum. They consider Hicks’s defeat was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
one over the English troops. One thing is good,
viz., that the Arabs came down to Giraffe, for if they
stay there, when the British do come they will fall
easy victims without any long march inland. It
certainly does seem astounding that the Arabs seem
so confident when a British force is only 150 miles
from them, which is the case, for that distance of
150 miles alone separates the three steamers from
Debbeh, which has a water-way to Dongola, and the
place the three steamers are at, has a water-way
to Kartoum. In reality, with a well-equipped force,
Debbeh is not more than eight days’ from Kartoum
at the outside, saying that the 150 miles were made
in six and a-half days, which for camels is twenty-five
miles a day, very easy marching; while, from
Metemma to this is 100 miles&mdash;a day and a half for
steamers (when I say Debbeh, I mean Ambukol, to
which place from Debbeh you have the open river).
The appearance of one British soldier or officer here
settles the question of relief <i>vis-à-vis</i> the townspeople,
for then they know that I have not told
them lies.</p>

<p>The Arabs fired fourteen rounds at the <i>Bordeen</i>.
The shell which entered her was a Krupp; the hole
is now repaired.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate remark of Ibrahim Ruckdi,
“Am I Commandant of soldiers?” I had dismissed
the thought of changing him, having comforted
myself that, one way or another, my tenure of
office could not be long up here, when he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
that; it was like a match in powder; he was brought
back, and made then and there to sign his dismissal.
I do not think he realised it, even after he had
written it. Even to me it was a surprise, for I really
had given up all idea of sending him off.</p>

<p>The sister steamer to the <i>Abbas</i> will be finished,
I hope, in four days. She will be called the <i>Hussein</i>,
after the head of the dockyard. The other one,
also a sister steamer, will be, I hope, finished in six
weeks, if we exist that time. Of the two steamers
at Berber with Arabs, the <i>Fascher</i> and the <i>Monsuhania</i>&mdash;the
latter is reported disabled.</p>

<p>I have ordered <i>Bordeen</i> to go on the White Nile
on patrol from Kalakli to Shoboloha; the <i>Ismailia</i>
is at Halfeyeh, <i>Towfikia</i> at Omdurman.</p>

<p>The Arabs, who went in numbers to Giraffe
to-day went back to their Dem at sunset.</p>

<p>We have another large steamer, the <i>Chabeen</i>, up
in our <i>dry-dock</i>, which I hope will be soon ready for
action.</p>

<p>A man came in from the Arabs; he says Seyd
Mahomet Osman has sent 300 camels to bring
his family from Shendy to Kassala (this is a bad
sign); he says the English have advanced towards
Berber.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 7.</i>&mdash;Ibrahim Ruckdi has fallen from £60
per month to £30. Sixteen soldiers with their arms
came in to-day from the Arabs, also one slave; they
had not much to say. Arabs had three guns against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the steamer yesterday; they kept one gun at
Giraffe, where they keep small detachments all
night. The Arabs pursued the men escaping, and
fired a few rounds, but did no harm; with these
men came in four women of theirs, quite a flock.</p>

<p>I really think the Arabs on the south side keep
such a way off because they are afraid of the captured
soldiers deserting. The sixteen men who came in
were splendid fellows, all nearly six feet; they say
a body of forty others have made up their minds to
come in a mass either to-day or to-morrow.</p>

<p>An Arab of Kartoum came in from Omdurman;
says grass huts are being made for the Mahdi’s
arrival there; man says the Arabs report “English
and Turkish troops at Debbeh.” <i>Towfikia</i> went
up the White Nile; saw a few Arabs, who fired
on her.</p>

<p>Another soldier has come in&mdash;the Arabs will be
furious; he says nine others have made up a party
to leave the Arab camp. The Arabs spread reports
that I kill all who come in; but the whole of the
soldiers of the Soudan know me of old, and so the
reports are not believed. This soldier was at
Berberah when last I saw him. I had moved all
the black soldiers from there to Senheit, as the
climate did not suit them. It is odd that Berberah,
Zeila, and Harrar suits the Egyptian and chocolate
faces; not the blacks, who suffer from pulmonary
complaints in those parts.</p>

<p>The sputtering of musketry on the lines this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
morning quite reminded me of old times. The
Arabs fired a good deal at the runaways.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-229.jpg" width="400" height="614"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Some of the officers are very anxious to go out
against the Arabs, but I do not see it. We are not
safe off the river banks, and there is no good risking
matters; besides which, we can never, with our force,
give them a crushing defeat, which will alone settle
the question; and we might, by a small defeat, drive
them into the desert, where one could not reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
them if other troops come up. We are now thus
placed (see Map), and in four days I shall have four
steamers between Shoboloha and Kalakla. In a
month I hope two more steamers will be ready:
total, <i>nine</i>. Arabs have <i>two</i> at Berber, <i>one</i> at Wad
el Medinet; of those at Berber only one is fit for
work, the <i>Fascher</i>.</p>

<p>I will mention a secret in all Egyptian administrations,
<i>i.e.</i>, if you give an order, it is totally
inefficient in three days’ time if not repeated again
and again at intervals; it seems as if its essence
evaporated in the heat of these countries. The
officers would laugh you to scorn if you said, “Why,
I gave a <i>standing order</i> respecting this or that.” It
would be to them perfectly ridiculous and absurd to
expect a “standing order” to be obeyed, unless <i>repeated</i>
at intervals. In most services, standing orders
are regarded, but certainly not in Egypt; this is the
reason why all those beautiful proclamations and
laws issued by the control and their successors, are
<i>dead letters</i> after ten days; they are constructed for
the European Press. What is needed, is continual
hammering at seeing your orders obeyed. Saleh
Pasha sent a man in with a message to me: “Mahdi
is coming with 40,000 men, etc., etc., etc.” This
is all rubbish. All Kordofan could not produce this
number; and if it could, the country could not
support them in food for five days.</p>

<p>Fearful row to-night because, after one-and-a-half
days’ warning, the <i>Bordeen</i> was going to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for Halfeyeh, no soldiers were found on board, and
this after repeated orders to Ferratch Pasha. Men
may say what they like, but one is bound to lose
one’s temper in such cases. This is the story Saleh
Pasha’s man tells: “Mahdi with 40,000 men is
coming to Omdurman, and will take it; he will then
plunge into the river and take Kartoum before the
English come.” I reply that “the Mahdi is not a
fool to think that by plunging into the river he will
take Kartoum, neither can he have 40,000 men with
him. <i>Put Saleh Pasha’s messenger into chains as a
spy of the enemy.</i>” We have spies direct from
the Mahdi’s camp, who say “he has not 3000 with
him.” This business was going at the same time as
my row with Ferratch Pasha&mdash;certainly one is not
on a bed of roses in this place.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 8th.</i>&mdash;One soldier who escaped this
morning, reports that the Arabs are furious at the
desertions of yesterday. Saleh Pasha’s messenger
(spoken of yesterday), on being put in chains, acknowledges
his statement is all fudge about Mahdi’s
40,000 men, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>A sergeant escaped from the Arabs; he says the
Arabs sent up about 200 black soldiers to Mesalamieh
to get grain, and they escaped to Sennaar;
that Waled a Goun meditates coming over, with
two guns, to the old Dem, which was previously
occupied by the son of Sheikh el Obeyed, on the
north side, near Halfeyeh, which, if he does, will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a great bore for us. The Mahdi is at Jura Hadra;
that a man had come from near Berber to say the
expedition was advancing towards that place. One
has heard so much of this sort of report that taken
with the report of Waled a Goun coming to Halfeyeh,
one is inclined to doubt it, for he would not
be likely to do that if it was true about the expedition
at Berber.</p>

<p>Sent out spy from Halfeyeh towards Shendy.</p>

<p>Whatever may happen, I hope it will be put to
our credit that we gave you the <i>Abbas</i> steamer,
and placed three steamers at your disposal at
Metemma,&mdash;when, if we had them we might have
cut the route between Jura on left bank of the
Nile, and Fakir Ibraham on the right bank of the
Nile,&mdash;besides using up 350 soldiers of our meagre
garrison in the equipages of those steamers!
Truly the indecision of our Government has been,
from a military point of view, a very great bore, for
we never could act as if independent; there was
always the chance of their taking action, which
hampered us.</p>

<p>Take the Tokar business: had Baker been supported
by, say, 500 men, he would not have been
defeated; yet, after he was defeated, you go and
send a force to relieve the town. Had Baker been
supported by these 500 men, he would, in all probability,
have been victorious, and would have pushed
on to Berber, and, once there, Berber would not have
fallen. What was right to do in <i>March</i>, was right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
to do in <i>February</i>. We sent an expedition in
March, so we ought to have sent it in February;
and then, the worst of it was, that Baker, having
been defeated, <i>when you did send your expedition to
Tokar</i>, Baker’s force no longer existed, and his
guns resist me at Berber. It is truly deplorable,
the waste of men and money, on account of our
indecision. Baker’s expedition ought never to have
been pushed forward, unless by small stages, supported
by forts. It had not more than fifteen or
twenty miles to go, and that distance ought to be,
so to say, sapped. Take your present expedition,
I do not know (<i>thanks to that Intelligence Department!</i>)
the details, but it seems to me that till
20th August, or thereabouts, we were supposed to
be quietly disposed of, but about that date our
resurrection occurred, and then, “Let us have an
expedition at once, and send for Wolseley.” Had
the men at Wady Halfa (Duncan) been told in
March (when he came up to Assouan) to make
<i>étapes</i> up to Dongola, they would have been all
ready for the expedition now. Personally, I do not
care, but I think what a perfect mess we would be
in, in an European war. I am convinced Wood,
the Sirdar, and many others, foresaw what was
likely to happen, but they did not consider they
were called upon to make a row about it. (Plutarch’s
Lives are out of print in our generation; we
do not like to be what club men call insubordinate,
though, of all insubordinates, the club men are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
worst.) What is the consequence? Why, an
infinite expense and great difficulty. Mark the way
the Mahdi treated Cuzzi: is it likely he did it for the
love of Cuzzi? was it not because Cuzzi told him of
Baring’s telegram, “that no troops will be sent to
Berber”? Remember, though I put these queries,
it is not I who put them: it is <i>history</i>. Why did
Baker go to Suakin, and Wood, the Sirdar, stay at
Cairo? One was chief of gendarmerie; the other
was commander-in-chief. It was not a question of
police, but of war. If it was right to let Sinkat
perish, it was right to let Tokar; if it was right to
relieve Tokar, it was right to see after Berber, and
thence on to Kartoum, Sennaar, Kassala, Bahr
Gazelle, and the Equator. At any rate, <i>be consistent</i>.
No one can question the right of the
Government to decide; but when they decide, let it
be a decision. “<span class="smcap">We will abandon altogether</span>, <i>and
not care what happens</i>.” That is a decision one can
understand, whether one approves or not. We are
not the judges; but what we have done is such,
that I declare I very much doubt what is really
going to be the policy of our Government, even
now that the expedition is at Dongola.</p>

<p>What were my ideas in coming out? They
were these: <i>agreed abandonment of Soudan, but extricate
the garrisons</i>, and these were the instructions
of the Government; and I only wish that
the public would look over Baring’s and my telegrams
exchanged from 28th February to 16th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
March, and see how he answered me:<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> it was as
if I was amusing myself up here. And then that
light-hearted fellow Egerton ... adds to it (“that
I am in Capua”), “What are your intentions in
staying at Kartoum?”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> I should like to see some
explanation why no efforts were made for the <i>relief</i> of
the <i>garrisons</i> before August (<i>not</i> <span class="smcap">my</span> <i>relief</i>). Berber
was known to have fallen in March; it may be said
the season was not good, then why in June does
Egerton tell me to make <i>contracts</i>? I hope
Stewart will <i>cut out all this biliousness</i>.</p>

<p>9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> <i>Telegraph cut with Halfeyeh.</i> This corroborates
rather what this man who came in to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
said, <i>i.e.</i> that the Arabs meditate coming again to
the Dem, north of this town, which will be a
trouble&mdash;it will be the beginning of a second
blockade, and I hope the <i>last</i>, for I declare I do
not think I could go through a third <i>blockade</i>&mdash;siege
is too great a word for it.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 9.</i>&mdash;Telegraph repaired with Halfeyeh.
The Arabs came down on the lines with two guns
and exchanged some shots with our people. Only
waste of ammunition.</p>

<p>One soldier escaped from the Arabs to-day. He
came from Sheikh el Obeyed. He says they have
got the gun which was captured at Katarif.</p>

<p>The Arabs fired seventeen shells this morning,
but did no harm.</p>

<p><i>Those Shaggyeh!</i> I will back them to try a man’s
patience more sorely than any other people in the
whole world, yea, and in the Universe. It is no use
detailing their efforts. I have now sent Moussa Bey
down to Halfeyeh. I really believe that they did try
the patience of the Arabs, from all I hear; for the
Arabs frequently thought of putting them to the
sword, and I can quite imagine Arabs having this
thought, from the wear and tear they have given me.</p>

<p>Of course, the officer on the lines reports masses
of Arabs killed to-day.</p>

<p>Sheikh el Obeyed killed all the prisoners he took
(who were inhabitants of Kartoum) in Mahomet
Ali’s defeat, near El foun.  I have ordered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
sale of 200 ardebs of grain, no one to buy more than
¼ ardeb.</p>

<p>Stewart will be annoyed at hearing “Ibrahim
Ruckdi is <i>very ill!!!!</i>” Illness dates from hour of
being turned out of head clerk’s place; he has not
sent for the doctor.</p>

<p>It will be a satisfaction for some to know that,
owing to their not sending me any news, I am exposed
to hearing all sorts of disquieting rumours
from the town, which, though I do not mind them,
are not destined to make one’s life lighter. The
Ulemas have been coming here for two days to see
me; they have been bothering for more grain, and
so I put off seeing them, but I gave them one ardeb
a piece. To-day, however, they pushed an interview,
but I still held out, and said they <i>must</i> tell my
Vakeel what they had to say. After a deal of palaver
my Vakeel came in to say, “<i>that the whole of the town
requested I would take back Ibrahim Ruckdi</i>.” What
an idea! I said “The town had better mind their
own business, and leave me to mind mine.” I think
it is lovely! and how Ruckdi must have worked at it
during his <i>severe illness</i>. Ruckdi had got at my
servants. Edrees, the butler, told me, with a look of
deepest commiseration, how ill Ruckdi was, on which
I laughed. I guessed he was on the sick list, and
had asked. “Yes” (with a deep sigh), “<i>Ruckdi was
very ill</i>.” “Illness commenced when?” I asked.
“Oh, a long time back, but duty and fidelity to <i>me</i>
had enabled him to crawl through his work,” at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which I laughed again. Then came the Ulemas, with
the town petition. I can quite imagine when men
have bribed the chief clerk A. to be favourable,
that it is a bother to have to go through the same
process with chief clerk B. on A.’s being turned out;
it upsets all calculations. Ruckdi will return to
Cairo with Tongi.</p>

<p>“See-saw,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> see-saw, why it is enough to kill a
fellow. I can’t keep my eyes open. I would give a
shilling to have an hour’s sleep! <i>Yes</i>, of course, <i>you</i>
say it is close at hand, <i>you black devil</i>!” “I know
your <i>Kareb</i> means at least three hours more.” “Give
you the water-bottle? I can’t. I don’t dare to touch
the rope of this long-necked brute. Hullo: there is
some one come a cropper. Rifle, ‘broken,’ of course,
it is, you cannot fall from a precipice without its
being broken.” “Hi! stop! Catch hold of the brute;
the machufat, as you call it, is slipping round. Can’t
you stop the brute (noise of a body falling); well,
there is an end of it. I will walk <i>now</i> sooner than
embark again on the ship of the desert. Am I
hurt? Oh, no, of course not; rather enjoyed sensation.
Walks half a mile, boots full of sand, and tries
it again.”&mdash;Scene in Desert: Explorations in Central
Africa, by Her Majesty’s Army.</p>

<p>The machufats<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> <i>will</i> slip forward, and camels <i>will</i>
object to people riding <i>on</i> their long necks; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<i>will</i> drop vesuvians on camels, who will not like
it; they <i>will</i> get galled, and have not glycerine; they
will drop their pipes, and not dare to descend for
them; they <i>will</i> pass baggage-camel with sharp
edged boxes, which will rasp their legs; as they
mount they will go over the other side and swear&mdash;oh
how they will swear! all their Topies will be
crushed&mdash;aches and pains in every part of the
body (I should be inclined to put them on ambulance
saddles, one on each side: awkward if they
meet a baggage caravan). “Tired and ill! of course
I am tired and ill after bowing and swaying my
body to and fro all night, with my eyes pricking like
as from so many needles, from desire to sleep; and
you may say what you like, I swear I saw more
than one of those skeleton camels get up, and I saw
houses as plain as I see you.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> I was between Scylla
and Charybdis. I wanted to sleep, and I was afraid
of falling off&mdash;shall never forget it.”</p>

<p>“Chermside to Kitchener: Any news of <i>him</i>?”</p>

<p>“Kitchener to Chermside: Nothing particular;
two or three more men down. Steamers at Metemma.
Abuse as usual of Intelligence Department.
Mahdi doing much better: <i>he</i> finds it more difficult
to get his letters through, and will have time to
get over <i>his</i> liver complaint and injustices. Stewart
says it was a perfect pandemonium to be boxed
up with him when in his tantrums.  <i>I hope you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
are well. Let me know if I can do anything for
you.</i>”</p>

<p>I think, in the interests of the Telegraph Department,
Floyer ought to make officers pay for
telegrams like this intercepted one.</p>

<p>A man came in from the Arabs on the South
Front. He says the Arabs have imprisoned the
regular troops with them; that the regulars want to
make a rush for our lines and to escape to us.</p>

<p>A boy came in four days absent from the Mahdi’s
camp, which is at a place opposite Gitana. He
says the Mahdi is moving along the left bank towards
Omdurman, and that he has with him all the
Europeans, Elias Pasha, and Slatin; that he will
try and take the place before the advance of the
English, who are said to be near Berber. Kordofan
is quiet. The Mahdi has about three to four thousand
with him. The Mahdi says he will cross the
river dry-foot&mdash;by a miracle.</p>

<p>Sent for the <i>Ismailia</i> from Halfeyeh, replacing
her by the <i>Towfikia</i>. The <i>Bordeen</i>, down the river,
will go to the same place on her return. Somehow
this advance of the Mahdi has raised my spirits;
nothing is more dead-like to be shut up as we have
been; now, at any rate, a month will see him victorious
or defeated, as God may will it. I think he
will try and negotiate, for, of course, Hussein Pasha
Khalifa has told him I had a Firman enabling
me to give up the country if I found some one to
take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kitchener to Chermside.&mdash;Hurrah! Capital
news! The Mahdi has <i>him</i> on the hip! he has
gone to Omdurman. Bottled <i>him</i> up now! We
will have no more impertinent remarks about the
Intelligence Departments. Dongola illuminated!
Regular feast of lanterns! Wish you were here,
old fellow; hope you are well! Can I, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>I declare Floyer ought to make them pay for
these telegrams&mdash;intercepted and brought here.</p>

<p>... “Well after a long night comes the dawn,
this is somewhat better news. I confess I was
never much taken up with Livingstone’s explorations,
and I never would have believed any one, if
he had told me I should be carrying out these explorations
with a British army. One must not be ungrateful,
but one may be permitted the remark why
that Mahdi did not move before he has quite
spoilt my holiday; why, dear me, in three months
I shall be back in that bear-baiting garden again,
being asked questions. What a life! What do
you say? I am sacrificing myself for my country.
Well, you are right there, I am a martyr, if ever
there was one.”</p>

<p>The mass of people who have come in from the
Arabs, have spread far and wide,&mdash;what is to be
expected from the Mahdi and his Government&mdash;so
I have no fear for the town, which I suppose has
40,000 inhabitants in it.</p>

<p>The Arabs prevent all coming to me&mdash;I prevent
none going to them&mdash;and I even give them written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
permissions to go; so I gauge the fidelity of the
people.</p>

<p>Small steamer got her steam up to-day, and I
hope will be finished in three days, armed and in
action.</p>

<p>I feel sure that the Mahdi comes with the idea
of negotiating; if so, and one can have reasonable
hope of success as to the extrication of the
garrisons, I shall negotiate&mdash;for up to the present
time, my original instructions are not abrogated, and
I feel sure Her Majesty’s Government will not wish
any longer campaign, than is necessary, in these parts,
for their honour, but it must be remembered <i>if</i>, by
negotiating, I get out the garrisons at the cost of the
steamers, &amp;c., &amp;c., I must not be blamed if in the
future, by the cession of the steamers and warlike
material, Egypt suffers. Her Majesty’s Government
gave me clear orders, <i>i.e.</i>, “get out garrisons and
evacuate”&mdash;these orders have not been cancelled
and are in force. No official notice is given me of
an advance of troops or of a change of policy;
therefore I am justified in acting on my original
instructions. Kitchener’s note is not sufficient to
justify me in disobeying my regular instructions.
Egerton’s telegram was not decipherable.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 10.</i>&mdash;The beginning of the year 1302 of
the Arabs is on the 21st October. On the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd October were Hicks’s defeats. The Mahdi,
bringing all the Europeans with him, makes his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
move look as if he were confident of his success
ultimately. All information tends to show that his
object is to starve us out. If the man would only
drop his prophet’s functions, we might come to
terms; but he will never do that, I fear. There is
one good thing in the Mahdi’s coming here&mdash;he
will be easy of access, if our Government wishes to
communicate with him; and also if he is defeated
there is an end of him, without going to Kordofan.
I suppose our people at Debbeh must be aware of
the whereabouts of the Mahdi at any rate.</p>

<p>It is an odd coincidence the advance of the
Mahdi and of the expeditionary force at the same
time, and to the same place (Armageddon).</p>

<p>I have 240 men at Omdurman, and it is pretty
strong. It is not likely to be attacked; for if the
Mahdi won it, he would not have gained Kartoum,
though it would be a trouble, as it would discourage
the people.</p>

<p>There is one bother, in any negotiations (which,
however, I do not think possible), viz. how far one
ought to go in <i>re</i> the steamers, and warlike store.
If I had Zubair here it might be settled, but now
the expedition is at Dongola it is a query what
ought to be done.</p>

<p>I have lost seven guns, two on board each
steamer, at Metemma, and one on board the <i>Abbas</i>.</p>

<p>This morning the Arabs fired six Krupp shells
into the lines, which did not burst.</p>

<p>Not a large church parade either at Kalakla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
South Front, or at Faki Mustapha, near Omdurman.
Two men came in, one from south front
with rifle, and one from Omdurman; the latter says
the Mahdi will come to Omdurman either to-day or
to-morrow, and will content himself with the investment
of the place. He has with him all the
Europeans, nuns and all. The Arabs meditate
coming over to the old Dem, near Halfeyeh, but
they say it will be the <i>Arabs of Waled a Goun</i> who
will come, <i>not</i> those of the Sheikh el Obeyed; this
is odd, and it would seem as if these two parties
had fallen out. We know Sheikh el Obeyed did
not agree with Abou Gugliz.</p>

<p>People do not appear a bit put out at the approach
of the Mahdi; in fact they look on it as a good
thing, for they say the affair will be ended here, and
there will be no necessity to go to Kordofan.</p>

<p>A very little Arab boy, with large, black, limpid
eyes, came in from the Arabs. He had been
captured some months ago.</p>

<p>The steamer <i>Bordeen</i> is still down the river,
robbing, I expect, right and left.</p>

<p>A Sandjak of Shaggyeh, who was for months a
prisoner with Sheikh Ibrahim (son of Sheikh el
Obeyed), told me how this latter used to quarrel
with Abou Gugliz, how the latter had taken the gun
they had captured from us; and how glad Sheikh
Ibrahim was when we beat Abou Gugliz at Giraffe.
On one occasion Abou Gugliz put Sheikh Ibrahim
in chains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Four of the Arab Krupp shells fell in the centre
of the town&mdash;did no harm&mdash;(regular bombardment
of Paris), moral effect, <i>nil</i>.</p>

<p>Little steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i> trial trip to-morrow.
The Arabs will think one of the large steamers has
been brought to bed.</p>

<p>One cannot help being amused at the Mahdi’s
carrying all the Europeans about with him&mdash;nuns,
priests, Greeks, Austrian officers&mdash;what a medley,
a regular Etât major. It will be a great crow for
Lord Wolseley if he manages to put an extinguisher
on the Mahdi.</p>

<p>Cambyses, son of Cyrus of Isaiah, lost his army
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 525, in these deserts, 2409 years ago.</p>

<p>The Mussulman year 1302 begins on the anniversary
of Trafalgar. “England <i>expects</i>” (does
not say even “thank you”) “you will do your
duty.”</p>

<p>Those who were ever quartered at Gibraltar
will remember two despatches over the mantelpiece,
Collingwood’s on Trafalgar; Wellington on
Waterloo. What a different tone in them. I cannot
help thinking the navy is more chivalrous than the
army in all nations; they are more seriously minded,
having gone through greater vicissitudes of danger.
I noticed flags around Faki Mustapha’s tent, and
three women came in this evening from Waled a
Goun’s camp, and reports that the Mahdi came to
Omdurman to-day; but a soldier who escaped with
his rifle came in afterwards and said the Mahdi had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not yet come to Omdurman, but was expected to-morrow.</p>

<p>In five days’ time I shall send down the <i>Towfikia</i>
steamer to Metemma, and order the <i>Talataween</i>
back. With the <i>Towfikia</i> I shall send
this journal up to date. The <i>Towfikia</i> will stay
at Metemma.</p>

<p>I have placed two of the castled santels at the
end of the lines on the White Nile, the other
two are at Bourré. The <i>Bordeen</i> steamer is back
from Shoboloha; she captured fifteen cows and
four slaves. She was fired on from the left bank
of the Nile.</p>

<p>Armed the men of the band and made them body
guard of Ferratch Pasha.</p>

<p>In future, for the defence of Kartoum, strong
forts ought to be built at Shoboloha, on both sides
of the defile.</p>

<p>The <i>Bordeen</i> telegraphed from Halfeyeh “important
spy captured.” I answered, “what did
important spy say?” I was answered, “Important
spy said that the English had sent out three men
to see about roads to Kartoum.” This was two
and a half hours’ work to get this information. It is
enough to drive one wild (a very small <i>mouse</i> for
such a <i>mountain</i>). Couriers were sent on horses to
and fro for this information. I am going to sit on
the captain of the <i>Bordeen</i> to-morrow. These
people, if they have a grain of information which
they (not I) think important, make a perfect Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Blanc of it, so as to get promotion. What on earth
of importance is it to us whether the British general
has sent 150 spies to look after roads.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Bordeen</i> gave the names of the
spies sent out by the British general obtained from
this “important spy,” thinking, of course, I should
be delighted. These things render one perfectly
furious, for, at least, twenty people were kept at
work for absolutely nothing; and like a born idiot,
there was I, on tiptoe of excitement, waiting information
of the “important spy,” to end with the
news that “three men had been sent out by the
British general.” Had “this important spy” said
the British general had started, it would have been
another thing, but that is in the future, and I do not
blame the British general for not rushing headlong
into these deserts.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 11.</i>&mdash;A sergeant-major came in at Omdurman
to-day, he left the Mahdi three days ago. The
Mahdi was then one day’s march from Omdurman, at
the place Stewart met the chiefs when he went up
the Nile in March. The Mahdi will be at the camp
Faki Mustapha to-night or to-morrow. He has
from 2000 to 3000 regulars with him, whom he
captured here and there. Three Krupp guns and
four mountain guns, but has a lot more mountain
guns en route from Kordofan. With the Mahdi are
Hussein Pasha Khalifa, Saleh Pasha, Slatin, and all
the Greeks, priests, and nuns, who have become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Muslim. A priest and a nun who refused to become
Muslim, he left in Obeyed. Nuchranza is with him.
He has a mixed multitude with him, who are not
over zealous, for he has discontented the people by
his exactions. They have plenty of meat, but not
much grain. The Frenchman spoken of (and supposed
to be Renan by me) has gone away from the
Mahdi. Fighting is going on in Kordofan in the
Gebel Nubar. Report is rife of the English being
at Debbeh. The Mahdi intends bombarding
Kartoum from the other side, and trying to demolish
the Fort Omdurman. The money captured
at Berber has not yet left Berber.</p>

<p>Another soldier came in from Waled a Goun’s
camp; he says the regulars are all in chains.</p>

<p>The Arabs are making a fort 2000 yards off the
south front. They fired eight rounds from a Krupp,
which entered the town but did no harm.</p>

<p>Four shells entered the town yesterday&mdash;one
slightly wounded five black sluts, one struck a house
belonging to the family of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>Small steamer’s trial trip took place to-day&mdash;a
great success; she snorts terribly.</p>

<p>Two more soldiers came in this morning from the
Sheikh el Obeyed. They say he intends coming to
the old Dem off the north front, where they were
before. They say he is not on the best of terms
with Waled a Goun. I hope sincerely he will not
come opposite to us.</p>

<p>Sent out two men separately to Debbeh, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
notification of the arrival of his holiness the Mahdi
at Omdurman.</p>

<p>Connected the Fort of Halfeyeh by telegraph to
river bank, 1500 yards.</p>

<p>Moussa Bey put in charge of the <i>Bordeen</i> and
<i>Ismailia</i>, and Omdurman and Mogrim.</p>

<p>Ferratch Pasha is made a Ferile (General of Division).
I am more generous than Her Majesty’s
Government (when a colonel, I used to make
Generals of Division. The Khedive used to tear
his hair over it). It may be that Ferratch Pasha
may be sold for 2¼$ in a fortnight, if the town is
taken, and be carrying water for one of the Mahdi’s
Ameers. I must say I am against doctors. If a man
is suffering intense pain, and is in a more or less
desperate condition, I would give as much morphine
as would still that pain. It was the custom of the
ancients to give to those who were to be crucified
a numbing potion, which is that mentioned in Matt.
xxvii. 34, Mark xv. 23. Our Lord would not abate,
by mortal means, the slightest pang of His passion,
and He would not taste it. But in our Lord’s case He
knew the object of giving Him this potion, whereas
a patient need not know it. Our doctors give a
composing draught to produce sleep, and I cannot
see why they stop at that and do not give a draught
to produce insensibility to pain&mdash;but I suppose they
have rules we know not of. Napoleon at Jaffa
asked the principal medical officer a question&mdash;whether,
with respect to the plague patients (whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he could not take with him in his retreat to Egypt,
and they would have had their throats cut had they
stayed) it would not be justifiable to give them
composing draughts. The principal medical officer
answered, “his business was to cure, not to kill.”
Now Napoleon did not say “do so,” but he merely
asked the question, inasmuch as it was certain that
the throats of those patients would be cut by the
Turks if they were left behind. History disputes
whether Napoleon did not get another doctor to
give the composing draughts, but it is certain that
the plague-stricken patients were killed by the
Turks (whether under the influence of composing
draughts or not it does not much signify).  To
my mind the principal medical officer was a snob,
and took advantage of Napoleon’s question to make
himself a hero. Napoleon alluded to it afterwards
at St. Helena, and I am inclined to believe his
version, viz. that he only put the alternative question
to the principal medical officer, and did not order
the giving of the composing draught. I shall now
conclude this Volume III. I have sent 200 men
to Omdurman, and am prepared to evacuate Halfeyeh
and place its garrison at Goba, if the Sheikh
el Obeyed moves to the north of this place.</p>

<p><i>October 12.</i>&mdash;Post left for Metemma by <i>Towfikia</i>
to-day. I am almost decided to evacuate Halfeyeh,
and put Shaggyeh, now there, at Goba.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> I dug up a
shell yesterday which was at the foot of a lay figure
at north side, and see that the reason of their (the
shells) not proving fatal is that they are buried too
deep, and their force is expended laterally&mdash;a man
must be over them to be hurt. Of course this would
be remedied in regular warfare. Were I to put them
out again, I would lay the shells on the surface of
the ground, hiding the fuses or ignitors, and run the
risk of their being seen. Men going to assault a
place do not pick their steps, as if they were
crossing a street. I have ordered the concentration
of guns on part of lines opposite to which Arabs
bombard us. I have ordered silence for the two or
three first rounds of the Arabs, and then to give
them some salvoes.</p>

<p>What with these people’s prayers, eating and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sleeping, one’s patience is indeed tried. I know
no people in the world who can take advantage of
cover better than them&mdash;the cover being “<i>I am
ill</i>;” that is a settler; for although you know it is the
illness of laziness, you can say nothing; if you doubt
it, you are universally voted a brute.</p>

<p>When you say to any escaped soldier, “Why do
you come here?” he replies, “Why, the Arabs give
us nothing. Why, with you I can get this or that.”
It is merely a question of what they can <i>get</i>. The
belly governs the whole world.</p>

<p>Have ordered the <i>Bordeen</i> steamer to creep up
when the moon rises, and attack the Arab ferry at
Kalakla.</p>

<p>Went over to Goba, and chose positions for the
Shaggeyeh tribe. If we evacuate Halfeyeh, we shall
have to give up three outer forts, and one central
one (Seyd Mahomet Osman’s house).</p>

<p>It is quite a danger to pass through the yard of
the Palace on account of the turkey-cock (though
he has a harem of five); he killed two of his
children the other day. I do not know if you have
noticed it, but when not angry, or in full dress, the
lobes of flesh about their necks are grey; but it does
not need half a minute for them to make them of
the most brilliant scarlet. I cannot understand how
they make part of their heads blue, while the appendages
are scarlet. I think the turkey-cock is
a bird worth studying; the tuft in front is peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to him alone. I know no other bird which has it.
I would give him the palm over all birds for pluck.</p>

<p>I have decided to bring those wretched Shaggyeh
over to Goba, and have sent boats for them.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>I declare solemnly, that if it were not for the
honour’s sake of our nation, I would let these people
slide; they are of the very feeblest nature, and the
Arabs are ten times better; but because they are
weak, there is so much more the reason to try and
help them; for I think it was because we were such
worthless creatures, that Our Lord came to deliver
us. These Shaggyeh know no shame. It is an
unknown quantity with them. What a life one has
to live. I wish I commanded the Arabs (speaking
professionally). I think it is a great shame not
giving me Zubair Pasha, for he would know how to
deal with these people. They are the weariness
of my life. From February until now they have
been one continued worry to me, and I expect they
worried the Arabs as much.</p>

<p>I have decided to put the Shaggyeh into the
North Fort, and not to occupy Goba. A slave
came in from Kerowé; had no news. The Arabs
did not fire upon the lines to-day, so concentration
of artillery fire on them did not come off. A woman
came into the Lines from Waled a Goun with a
letter.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> <i>Towfikia</i> was to have left this morning;
but late last night, happening to go to the telegraph
office, and asking whether she was all ready, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
captain replied he had no wood! so there was an
end of her start to-day.</p>

<p>I particularly wish to ascertain how many communications
were sent me from Cairo or elsewhere
in Egypt between the 12th of March, when the
telegraph wire was cut, and the present date.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> I
hope Stewart will get this information for me, and
not be hoodwinked about it. I should also much
like the substance of those communications.</p>

<p>The letter was from Abou Gugliz sending in
a woman who had before been a spy. He begs
me to become a Mussulman, &amp;c. The woman
who brought it, says the Mahdi comes to-night to
Omdurman, and that he says, as soon as he comes,
<i>I shall ask to surrender</i>! The Mahdi says he
will write me three letters; he will then wait for
five days, and that he will then advance across the
river, which will divide for him. Looking at the date
which will be arrived at, after these letters are written
and the five days’ grace have expired, and making
allowances for what is meant by the dividing of the
waters, it would bring the Mahdi’s attack about the
21st October, the New Year’s day of 1302 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span><a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>We hear the Arabs are perplexed, because the
other day, when they bombarded us, we did not
answer. This was my doing to save ammunition.
The Arabs asked the regulars with them, “why we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
did not answer?” and said they were sure the
regulars were in communication with us. We are
now weighing the pros and cons for not answering
the artillery fire of the Arabs, which do us no harm
and uses up their ammunition. By not doing so we
do not lose the sympathies of the regulars, whereas if
we do so we exasperate and render desperate those
regulars. We had an instance of that at Bourré,
where at first the regulars were well disposed
towards us, and came over in numbers; whereas
after we had killed a lot of them they ceased to
come in, and used to fight us with viciousness.</p>

<p>The woman says, beyond the captured regulars,
Arabs have no fighting force. These captured
regulars are mostly all blacks.</p>

<p>Another <i>plot</i>? In town a man was discovered
taking out a note couched in mysterious language,
from one of the clerks in a Government office.
With the note was £34, supposed to be a present
to the Mahdi from Sheikh el Islam (the blind man)
here. The efforts to square the circle are extraordinary.
The people here, I expect, have all
hedged. I am going to make a sort of general arrest
to-night (similar to that made by Napoleon III.
on the night of the 1st December) of all who are supposed
to be in communication with the Mahdi.
I shall not hurt them, but shall send them out to the
Mahdi. Query, was it on the night of the 1st and
2nd December Napoleon took his foes prisoners,
or on the night of the 2nd-3rd December? I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
it was the night of the 1st-2nd December, and the
so-called massacre happened during the day of the
2nd December. (Vide Kinglake in ‘Coup d’étât.’)</p>

<p>I shall not send out the Sheikh el Islam<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> although
he is a disgrace. I asked Mahomet Edrees, my
servant, “to become a Christian.” He said “he
could not.” Then I said, “Why ask me to
become a Mussulman, when your Sheikh el Islam is
prepared to acknowledge Mahomet Achmet as the
Mahdi?” 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;The arrests are out. Sheikh el
Islam, Cadi, and a host of swells are to be kept in
their homes&mdash;sixteen in all! A good swoop; among
them the Mudir Achmet Bey Jelaba. I have made
Moussa Bey Mudir. There will be quite a scare
about it. I have not sent any away to the Mahdi.
The band boys are all armed, and are quite
ferocious. It would be a great mistake to come up
here and think to find soldiers <i>in extremis</i>; they
are as cocky as possible. They strut along as if
no one was their equal. The blacks are a stubborn
race; and if one sticks to them, they will stick to
you.  <i>Towfikia</i> has left for Metemma <i>at last</i>.</p>

<p>A mouse has taken Stewart’s place at table; she
(judging from her swelled-out appearance) comes up
and eats out of my plate without fear.</p>

<p>The turkey-cock has become so disagreeable that
I had to put his head under his wing and sway
him to and fro till he slept. The cavasses thought
he was dead, but he got up and immediately went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
at me. The putting the head under the wing acts
with all birds, but it is the <i>cock</i> alone who gets
mesmerised by the chalk lines drawn in front of his
beak. How do you account for this?</p>

<p>I believe that a good recruitment of blacks and
Chinese would give England all the troops she
wants for expeditions, mixed with one-sixth English.
As for those wretched Sepoys, they are useless.
I would garrison India with Chinese and blacks,
with one-sixth English, and no army could stand
against us. The Chinese in Shanghai had the
greatest contempt for the Bombay Sepoys, and used
to knock them about. Beloochees and Sikhs are
a different class. I have the greatest contempt for
the pure Indian Sepoys. Chinese, or blacks, or
Goorkas, or Belochees are far better. The moment
he (the pure Sepoy) is off parade, he puts off all
uniform that connects him with Her Majesty’s
Government, and puts on his dish-clout. I hate
these snake-like creatures. Any man accustomed
to judge by faces sees that they hate us.</p>

<p>I would back the Mussulmans of India against
the lot of those snakes. India, to me, is not an
advantage; it accustoms our men to a style of
life which they cannot keep up in England; it
deteriorates our women. If we kept the sea-coast,
it is all that we want. It is the centre of all petty
intrigue, while if our energy were devoted elsewhere,
it would produce tenfold. India sways all
our policy to our detriment. Lord Cardwell replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
(when I asked him the question as to the benefit we
got from India), “<i>that we could not get out of it</i>,”
and I suppose that is the answer that must be given.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 13.</i>&mdash;Cavalry sortie this morning from
Bourré; captured fifteen slaves and killed thirteen
men who resisted. This sortie was under Abdoul
Hamid, the Sandjak of the Shaggyeh. We lost
none.</p>

<p>The Arabs on Omdurman side have spread out
their huts in a semicircle (but at a considerable
distance) around Omdurman, on the left bank.</p>

<p>Shaggyeh from Halfeyeh will be in the North
Fort to-day. The Arabs off South Front, near the
White Nile, fired musketry against the lines, but
did no harm.</p>

<p>Last night cavalry Shaggyeh captured three men
who were going off to Sheikh el Obeyed from
Halfeyeh; they had their arms with them. I have
let them go again.</p>

<p>No definite news yet of the arrival of the Mahdi
at Omdurman. The Mahdi will be furious with this
cavalry sortie; it will be disagreeable news to him
on his arrival here.</p>

<p>A man from the Arabs has come in to Omdurman
with two letters;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> it is too late to see them
to-night. By telegraph I hear that the man brought
two letters for the Commandant at Omdurman from
Faki Mustapha, saying the Mahdi was coming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
day after to-morrow, and inviting him to submit;
so I have told them to send the man off again.</p>

<p>We are a wonderful people; it was never our
Government which made us a great nation; our
Government has been ever the drag on our wheels.
It is, of course, on the cards that Kartoum is taken
under the nose of the expeditionary force, which
will be <i>just too late</i>.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The expeditionary force will perhaps think it
necessary to retake it; but that will be of no use,
and will cause loss of life uselessly on both sides.
It had far better quietly return, with its tail between
its legs; for once Kartoum is taken, it matters little
if the Opposition say “You gave up Kartoum,” or
“You gave up Kartoum, Sennaar,” &amp;c., &amp;c., the
sun will have set, people will not care much for the
satellites. England was made by adventurers, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
by its Government, and I believe it will only hold
its place by adventurers. If Kartoum falls, then go
quietly back to Cairo, for you will only lose men
and spend money uselessly in carrying on the
campaign.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 14th.</i>&mdash;I have been obliged to make some
more arrests. Report in says many of the people,
chiefs, &amp;c., of Shendy come in to the three steamers
now at Metemma; also that the steamers have
been firing on the Arabs of Metemma; report says
that expedition advance guard is at Abou Hamed,
remainder at Merowé; that some English are
coming from Kassala with Seyd Mahomet Osman
to Gros Ragéb; that the Sakkeyer Arabs meditate
a raid on Shoboloha tribes, who are favourable to
Government. The Arabs fired on the lines this
morning, doing no harm. Made Ferratch Ullah,
who used to be at the Palace, a Miralli.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>In the two letters,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Faki Mustapha says the
English are prisoners at Assouan, and that the
Arabs had captured <i>Abbas</i> with Stewart at Cataract
Dar Djumna, below Abou Hamed, <i>which would be
dismal</i>!</p>

<p>Arabs are keeping a long way off the lines since
the cavalry sortie.</p>

<p>No sign of the arrival of the Mahdi at Omdurman.
Very few horsemen to be seen on the South Front.
Query, have they gone down towards Berber?</p>

<p>This evening, some twelve of those arrested and
allowed to stay in their houses are to be taken to the
barracks; I hate those arrests, but one can scarcely
doubt so many informants, who declare there was
“trahison” meditated, not from any wish to join
Mahdi, but for fear I was not strong enough to
hold the city, and owing to Awaan’s statement,
<i>that he had written the letters</i> I had received from
Debbeh announcing that the expeditionary force was
coming.</p>

<p>The North side is like a market, with the camels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
horses, sheep, goats, donkeys, of the Shaggyehs,
who have come up from Halfeyeh, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I confess I am more perplexed about these arrests
than I like; is it a good thing? or is it not? If I
could be sure that the majority wished to go to the
Mahdi, I could make up my mind at once what to
do; it would be an immense relief to me, but does
the mass wish it? If they do not, I ought to take
all precautions against such an event. Then comes
the query. Am I not, in these arrests, being made
a tool of by the Turkish and Cairo elements? Are
they not gratifying spites? Paul said, “<i>I have
learned</i>” (as in a school) “<i>in whatsoever state I am
to be content</i>.” I can only say, “<i>I am learning,”
but have “not learned</i>.”</p>

<p>No sign this evening in Faki Mustapha’s camp
of the arrival of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>Heavy thunderstorm and rain this evening, which
will be made out by the proselytes of Mahomet
Achmet as a proof of his divine pretensions. It is
rather bad for our mines.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 15th.</i>&mdash;No spies in&mdash;everything quiet.
Some begin to doubt if Mahdi is so near.</p>

<p>People say I must have some news of relief,
otherwise I would not have made the arrest of
Mudir, Cadi and Sheikh el Islam, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I see there was a total eclipse of the moon on
4th October, and there is a partial eclipse of the sun
on the 18-19th October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>I reason thus respecting the arrests: if the people
really want to go over to the Mahdi, it will make
no difference beyond hastening the event; if they do
not want to go to the Mahdi it will make no difference.
If there is a minority to go to the Mahdi
the arrests have upset their plans, at any rate for a
time. To my idea, these people were only <i>hedging</i>,
in order to be prepared for all contingencies.</p>

<p>Mahomed Pasha Hassan, who is a barometer of
fear, approves of the step&mdash;so I hear in an indirect
way:&mdash;<i>of course</i> every body approves of it, if <i>asked</i>
by <i>me</i>, for fear of their own arrest.</p>

<p>I had to make three more arrests&mdash;when once
one begins this detestable practice, one never can
stop. As far as I can judge the mass of people
approve of the arrests. I am now going on the
principle “in for a penny, in for a pound.” Wilfrid
Blunt will make a nice row about this. It is very
odd we have had no one in from the Arabs for two
days. Glad to say I found out one arrest not just,
and have let the man out.</p>

<p>Jeremiah was arrested over and over again, and
let out by King Zedekiah. I wonder how any man
can possibly wish to enjoy despotic power: he can
never be happy or comfortable if he has any pretensions
to a conscience.</p>

<p>2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Six flags appeared at Faki Mustapha’s
camp. Report in town says the Mahdi is at his
Isle of Abba, 160 miles up White Nile, attending to
the circumcision of his son (poor little fellow). I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
hope it is true, for it will give us ten days’ respite.
He may also have another dream there, which
will tell him not to come to Kartoum, or he may
persuade his followers to have one to same effect.
What a comfort!!!</p>

<p>The Mahdi will make it an excuse that he came
for this circumcision from Kordofan to Abba
Island (where he received his first revelation that
he was the <i>Mahdi</i>), if he sees things go against
him.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;The six flags at Faki Mustapha’s camp
have increased to ten (gathering of waters). We
have just completed <i>our</i> concentration of forces,
and the steamers have just come in from their last
trip from Halfeyeh. We may now be said to be in
fighting trim, close hauled. Small steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i>
will be completed to-morrow, I hope.</p>

<p>6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Horsemen riding to and fro in Faki
Mustapha’s camp. A letter has come in with two
men from Slatin. Have received the letter, and
send back the men who brought it, at once. “You
must remember,” says England, “that when you
entered my service, I bought you, as far as your
body was concerned, giving you at first 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per
diem, when no one else would have given you 1<i>s.</i>,
giving you also a beautiful plumage and the <i>entrée<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
partout</i>. You have advanced now to higher pay,
but on <i>same terms</i> (your whole life and body).
You can never say you have done <i>more</i> than your
duty. If you do not do it you break your word,
and if you do it you merely fulfil your contract, and
have no <i>claim</i> on me.”</p>

<p>The two men who came in with the letter of
Slatin were one Arab and one slave. The latter
questioned (apart) says that the report is <i>that the
Mahdi will come in two days to Omdurman; that he
has not been seen; that the regular soldiers have
gone back to Kordofan; and that Faki Mustapha
told him</i> (the slave) <i>to frighten the Kartoumers</i>.
I am hoping the Mahdi will prove a <i>bogie</i>!</p>

<p>Steamers <i>Bordeen</i> and <i>Ismailia</i> went down below
Kerowé to-day, and saw no Arabs on the left bank
of the Nile.</p>

<p>The quietude of Sheikh el Obeyed’s forces is
curious, for they have twice beaten us, <i>with heavy
loss</i>, though they have been beaten by us, with loss,
at other times, but in minor engagements.</p>

<p>I begin to get over my disquietude <i>in re</i> the
arrests; from what I hear, I think public opinion is
not dissatisfied; but really it was a strong measure
to arrest Sheikh el Islam, Cadi and Mudir, and
sixteen others, and that without turning the two
former out of their employ.</p>

<p>A lot of people were pressing for harder measures,
but my new chief clerk said “we would wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
leave it to you to do or not to do,” which is lively,
as I am innocent of what goes on, or who is a traitor,
or who is not; if ever there was a happy-go-lucky
government, it is this, in Kartoum. I declare that,
sometimes, I give a decision, and have no more
idea of what the decision is about than a cow; these,
however, are exceptional cases. I have had about
six bad slips in ten years, not more, and these
I have managed to rectify, with loss of prestige.
Slatin is <i>not</i> with Faki Mustapha, so says the slave.
What liars these spies are!</p>

<p>If in two days I find the news correct that the
Mahdi is still in Kordofan, I shall let out all the
political prisoners (which will shock the townpeople),
but will be true joy and delight to me, for it has
been a work utterly repugnant to me. I like free
will (we left God with <i>our own free will</i>, we must
return with our <i>own free will</i>). I hate a forced subjection,
and I feel sure that to let these people out,
with free will to go to the Arabs or not, will be
good policy. I must say that I feel it a great compliment,
when my counsellors say to <i>me, “Do what
you think right, irrespective of our advice,” when
they know I am ignorant of all that goes on, ignorant
of the Arabic language, except in my style, ignorant
of the Arab customs, &amp;c., &amp;c. “You will do better
than we do</i>,” is what they say, and <i>I, poor Devil, do
not know where to turn</i>. Oh! our Government, our
Government! what has it not to answer for? Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
to <i>me</i>, but to these poor people. I declare if I
thought the town wished the Mahdi, I would give it
up: so much do I respect free will.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 16.</i>&mdash;The letters of Slatin have arrived.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
I have no remarks to make on them, and cannot
make out why he wrote them.</p>

<p>Heavy rain last night, I expect there is an end to
the vitality of our mines, and we have now no more
matches to renew them.</p>

<p>No spies in, no Arabs visible outside their camp:
it is pretty certain that the Mahdi has not come to
Omdurman.</p>

<p>The Austrian Consul<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> has asked me to let him
write to Slatin, and to allow him to give him (Slatin),
an interview on the Lines, which I have agreed to
and sent out. Slatin’s letter to Hansall was quite
in a different tone to the one he wrote to me.
What astounding lies those spies have told about
the Mahdi and his heterogeneous staff being close
here.</p>

<p><i>Noon.</i>&mdash;Two spies came in, one from Sheikh el
Obeyed, one from Kordofan. The latter says the
Mahdi is not coming to Kartoum, but has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
recalled to Obeyed on account of the advance of
expeditionary force; that the Mahdi has withdrawn
all the regulars captured here and there from our
vicinity to Kordofan; that a lot of the Arabs he
forced to come with him have deserted him. That
is about all; one feels disinclined to write these histories,
which are contradicted a few days afterwards.
Certainly the Arabs are very quiet, and one does
not see many about. I hope to be able to let out
the prisoners on New Year’s Day of Arab year 1302,
which is on 21st October. I shall make Ferratch
Pasha do the honours of the day, I cannot stand
these pageants. A woman came in from the Dem on
the South Lines; she says a few days ago there was
a regular panic caused by report of troops having
captured Katarif; half the Arabs went southward.
However the report was contradicted and they have
come back.</p>

<p>Slatin’s letter to Austrian Consul contains the
remark “that if he comes over to me I must promise
never to surrender the city, <i>as he would then suffer
terrible tortures and death</i>.” He evidently is not a
Spartan, he also says “that he changed his religion
because he had not had much attention paid
to his religious belief when young.” If he gets
away I shall take him to the Congo with me, he
will want some <i>quarantine</i>; one feels sorry for him.</p>

<p>Slatin says there is a rumour that a boat of
Stewart’s expedition, down Nile, was captured by
Arabs at the cataract Dar Djumna, below Abou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Hamed, but he doubts its truth; this, in his letter
to the consul.</p>

<p>The Arabs have not occupied Halfeyeh. The
Shaggyeh are pulling down Goba and Hogali, the
village opposite the Palace. The village of Omdurman
is levelled. The little steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i> is
finished and armed, and will go up against the
Arabs (her virgin trip), on Saturday morning. They
have put a little lion as figure-head to it.</p>

<p>Fancy post-office officials (of all people), who have
done literally nothing for seven months (not being
<i>able</i> to do anything), asking for increase of pay!!
These people have no conscience. There were very
few Arabs to be seen on south front this day, and
few were seen going to Giraffe. At Faki Mustapha
there also seems no numbers, in spite of the great
array of grass huts erected for the Mahdi. Report
in town says that the Arabs in Kordofan say the
Mahdi is all fudge, and that they are robbed more
now under his name than before, when they were
under the Government.</p>

<p>Report says the Mahdi sent Sheikh el Obeyed
(the <i>man</i> not the <i>city</i>) to tell him to come to
Obeyed (the <i>city</i> not the <i>man</i>), and devotes himself
to God’s service as a dervish. The Sheikh el
Obeyed (the <i>man</i> not the <i>city</i>)<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> does not see it, for
he is very rich (I know it is a horrid nuisance these
names, but I did not give them). It would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
charity to execute the <i>man</i>, for those who are
perplexed, and end the difficulty. We cannot execute
the city.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 17.</i>&mdash;Church parade at minimum: that at
Faki Mustapha’s Dem some 400: that at south
front not more than a 1000.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone has a rival up here in shirt collars:
Mohamed Bey Ibrahim appeared to-day
with regular wings rather ragged,
his collars up to his ears, regular
orthodox patterns.</p>

<p>I am sending <i>Bordeen</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i>
up the White Nile to reconnoitre,
and the horsemen out towards Giraffe and
Halfeyeh.</p>

<p>I shall have nothing to do with Slatin’s coming
in here to stay, unless he has the Mahdi’s positive
leave, which he is not likely to get: his doing so
would be the breaking of his parole, which should
be as sacred when given to the Mahdi as to any
other power, and it would jeopardise the safety
of all those Europeans, prisoners with Mahdi.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>According to all accounts, the cataract at Dar
Djumna below Abou Hamed is a very small one,
so I am in hopes it is a false rumour that we have
lost the boat. A slave came from Faki Mustapha,
saying the Mahdi is at Jura Hadra, his people
suffering from sickness: many have gone back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Khordofan. All regulars have gone back, they
have little grain, and people are discontented. This
man brought his rifle in with him; 219 days to-day
we have been boxed up; four of the principal men
were allowed to be prisoners in their houses, one of
these allowed a man to come to him and bribe the
sentry with two dollars: this man was whipped off to
the prison at once. The Sheikh el Islam let two
women come to him, he was only threatened. We
caught a man going over to the Arabs to-day, he
had under his ordinary costume the Dervish dress.
If Zubair was here he would take off heads I feel
sure. I content myself with fearful threats, which
they know are nothing.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 18.</i>&mdash;The <i>cavalry</i> went out towards Giraffe,
and captured five <i>female</i> slaves! and killed three
Arabs, who resisted their being taken. I own I do
not feel satisfied with the killing of these men, but I
suppose it is <i>war</i>: we lost none. The captive ladies
had little to say more than the Arabs had two guns
at Giraffe.</p>

<p><i>Bordeen</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i> went up the White Nile,
saw no Arabs at first, but coming back Arabs got
down two guns and opened fire, they killed one
man and wounded another. I had warned these
steamers distinctly to keep in the middle of river,
and not to go near the banks. The casualities
were from musketry. Arabs fired fifteen rounds
(gun), <i>Husseinyeh</i> fired ten rounds (gun), <i>Bordeen</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
fired ten rounds (gun). I have stopped these
steamers going up the White Nile for the future.
The officer is entirely responsible for the death of
this man, for I had given orders that, <i>even</i> if they
saw cattle or boats, they were not to be enticed to
the banks to get them. I never will believe in ships
against land batteries, unless troops are landed, for
<i>unless</i> a steamer can get close alongside a battery,
the battery will hold its own.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 19.</i>&mdash;This morning, in spite of my orders
not to leave the lines, Bourré must needs send
out men, and the consequence was that I have a
Bimbashi and six men wounded, however I think
I have stopped these excursions for the future.
The <i>cavalry</i> went out from the North Fort to
Halfeyeh, and saw no one, and captured a cow!</p>

<p>I hope it will be remembered that with respect to
white troops (Fellaheen) on board the now four
steamers at Metemma, I make you a handsome
present of them (officers and all), and request that if
you use the steamers you will disembark those men
and take them on your list, for we never wish to see
them (and to have to feed them) up here again. <i>You
will be carrying out the evacuation policy!!!</i> If you
do not use the steamers, please send them back <i>empty
of these Fellaheen troops</i>, but send me <i>their rifles</i>. You
will soon have a fine contingent? for I have everything
ready for a <i>general discharge of Cairo débris</i>
(Bashi Bazouks, &amp;c., &amp;c.), the moment I hear you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
are really at Berber; I shall not wait to ask your
leave, for I have had enough of the débris up here,
and you can feed them better than we can; <i>at any
rate, they will be off my hands</i>, and <i>on yours</i>. I hope
it will be an understood thing that <i>every Egyptian
soldier</i> you find <i>belongs to you</i>, and that you will not
send him back to me. I nobly present you <i>with them
all</i>, and then, besides that, you have the glory of
living representatives of your rescuing expedition.
I object and protest against (when once Egyptian
soldiers come into your lines) your returning them to
Kartoum. As for their pay, &amp;c., as far as I have
been able to order, it ought to be quite clear what is
owed them. I have given orders enough about that
subject, as Stewart knows. I include <i>officers</i> as <i>well
as men</i>. I want to see them no more. <i>Pray attend
to this request!</i><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Talataween</i> came in this evening from
Shendy; reports Seyd Mahomet Osman has come
to Gros Rageb with English troops. English
troops are coming from Debbeh by Nile, and have
passed Abou Hamed. Arabs captured two boats
of Stewart’s expedition, by means of the captured
steamer <i>Fascher</i> above Abou Hamed, which our
steamers had seen getting up steam: <i>vide</i> my journal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
I had a feeling about this that when the steamers
had seen the Arab steamer <i>Fascher</i> getting up steam
they ought to have staid and tried to prevent the
pursuit. The Arabs have a gun at Shendy, which
came from Berber. The English troops are only
two days distant from Berber. The steamers had
twenty-five wounded, they collected eleven prisoners,
and captured four boats. One of our men was
killed. The <i>Towfikia</i> lost none on going down. I
am sending down the <i>Bordeen</i> and <i>Talataween</i> the
day after to-morrow to Shendy, with order to leave
one steamer at Shendy, and go on with the other
four to Berber, and to remain in its neighbourhood.
The <i>Mansowrrah</i> will stay at Shendy, and the
<i>Talataween</i>, <i>Bordeen</i>, <i>Saphia</i>, and <i>Towfikia</i> will
go towards Berber. I shall keep <i>Ismailia</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i>
here.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>October 20th.</i>&mdash;Here is a summary of reports
brought by <i>Talataween</i>, which left Shendy four days
ago. <i>Abbas</i> went down to Hagar Homar with her
four boats. She was pursued by <i>Fascher</i>, which
captured two of her boats, with twelve Greeks.
The <i>Abbas</i> turned and fired two cannon shots at the
<i>Fascher</i>, which retired, and the <i>Abbas</i> went on her
way and was seen no more. She is supposed to
have been attacked by Arabs below Abou Hamed
and drove off attack, killing seventy-two Arabs,
the Greeks captured in the two boats were not hurt
by the Arabs. When the <i>Abbas</i> got to Debbeh the
troops advanced towards Berber. Three distinct
parties moving on Berber: <i>one</i> through the desert
of Korosko (the Arabs have put 1500 men and a
gun at Abou Hamed); <i>one</i> from Merowé to Berber
across the desert (making forts at intervals), and <i>one</i>
with Seyd Mahomet Osman down the Atbara valley
towards El Damer (which place is at the junction of
the Atbara with the Nile) assisted by Awad Kerim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The steamers have been bombarding Metemma and
Shendy, I expect with no great effect.</p>

<p>To-day came in from Waled a Goun two men
and three women. They say the Mahdi is opposite
Kalakla, <i>i.e.</i> within two miles of Kartoum, few
people with him; those who came with him from
Kordofan have, in great part, gone back.</p>

<p>In yesterday’s skirmish the Arabs lost two men
in the steamer fight, the day before they lost more.
Waled a Goun has sent his family to Gitana;
many are deserting.</p>

<p>An officer and sergeant have escaped and come
into Omdurman.</p>

<p>They say that the Arabs of Berber were warned
by someone in the town of the descent of the <i>Abbas</i>.
I have ordered the sale of 200 ardebs of Dhoora on
the strength of this news. A man, who was at
Berber, on board one of the captured steamers says
Ferratch Pasha! and other officers have sent news
to the Arabs, and that the Arab chief of Berber
wrote to Cassim el Mousse, proposing he should
kill me, which Cassim el Mousse refused to do.
This Mahomet el Khair is a true cur, for I have
ever treated him well. I expect if the truth was
known very few notables or officials have not been
hedging with the Arabs.</p>

<p>The Shaggyeh on the opposite side are yelling,
on enquiring find it is for Dhoora; they have had
their month’s rations and the month is not up. I
went to the telegraph office and told them that “till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the month was up I would give them none, but
that the Sheikh el Obeyed had plenty, and that if
they liked they could go to him;” no answer was
given to this telegram.</p>

<p>The officer and sergeant who came in at Omdurman
say the Mahdi with all Europeans, Hassan
Khalifa, Saleh Pasha, and <i>that</i> Frenchman are
opposite Kalakla, and that he means coming to
Omdurman, that the Arabs are not in good heart.</p>

<p>The <i>Saphia</i> and the <i>Mansowrrah</i> ought to have
laid off Berber, and prevented the exit of the
<i>Fascher</i> when the <i>Abbas</i> went down, but I expect
they only cared to come back here. I am much put
out at the loss of those two boats. What one has
felt so much here is the want of men like Gessi,
or Massodaglia, or Slatin; but I have had no one
to whom I could entrust expeditions like that. <i>I do
sincerely hope all Egyptians and Turks or Circassian
officers and men may be taken out of the steamers and
kept by you; it would be too bad to send them back to
me.</i>. I do not mean the <i>captains</i> or <i>engineers</i> of
<i>steamers</i>. Twenty-two wounded men were brought
to the hospital (four were gravely wounded) from
Shendy steamer. I wish you to take command of
steamers, but do not let any <i>Khedival authority</i> do
so, <i>for he will certainly be bribed to let back the
Egyptians</i>. Please acknowledge the receipt of the
Journal, of which this is Vol. 4. As far as my experience
goes, there are not more contemptible troops,
officers, and men than the Egyptians, so beware of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
them, and, with scarcely an exception, all Turks and
Circassians in Egyptian employ are emasculated.</p>

<p>I have prepared to clear out of the Palace, and
have five houses ready for occupation. I hope
Cuzzi’s baggage will be searched, for I feel sure he
is a traitor. A slave came in this evening from
Waled al Goun with the usual story of the near
approach of the Mahdi; that Arabs want food; that
regulars mean to desert when they get an opportunity.
With the reiterated request that I may not
have any <i>Egyptians, Turks, or Circassians sent back
to me</i>, I end this Journal.</p>

<p><i>October 21.</i>&mdash;Steamers left this morning for
Shendy. To-day is New Year’s Day of the Arabs,
1302. I think the Mahdi speculated on a rising in
the town, but that the arrests<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> have put him out in
his calculations.</p>

<p>New Year’s gift this morning, in arrival of Mahdi
at Omdurman. Not much display. It is reported
that he will occupy Kerowé and Halfeyeh at once;
so it is as well I got the steamers off before he got
his guns down to river bank. They will be safe
with you,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and very useful.</p>

<p>Two men came in from Saleh Bey of Galabat
with the post. They were thirty-two days <i>en route.</i>
They brought a letter from Mitzakis, the Greek
Consul, from <i>Adowa</i>, dated 17th August (which told
me as much, or more, than Kitchener’s letter of
31st August!).<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Saleh Bey is all right; he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
attacked. Spies say the small steamer <i>Mahomet
Ali</i>, captured by the Arabs, is now on the Blue Nile,
at Abou Haraz. Sennaar is all right.</p>

<p>Mitzakis writes to the Greek Consul here to say
that a treaty has been made between Her Majesty’s
Government and Abyssinia, to give Abyssinia
Kassala, Galabat, Katarif, and Bogos! and that
the King is preparing an army to go and take
possession.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> What an action. These lands (except
Bogos) are entirely Mussulman, have held their
own, and are in no way threatened, and <span class="smcap">we</span> go
and send a wild <i>so-called</i> Christian people (who have
nothing to do with the quarrel) against these peoples,
who have held their own against the Mahdi.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 22.</i>&mdash;I wonder what Saleh Bey of Galabat
will say to this cession, after he has been fighting
for me. Also what Seyd Mahomet Osman will say
after all his trouble.</p>

<p>I can now see why I was kept in the dark.</p>

<p>In one of Saleh Bey’s letters he says he sends
me a letter from King John. This I have not got;
it apparently was not sent.</p>

<p>A man came in with letter from Slatin, in which
he says the <i>Abbas</i> was captured near Dar Djumna.
Stewart killed, with nine men, and all the papers
captured.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Three soldiers escaped yesterday from the Arabs.
Seven more came in to-day; they had no news.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Mahdi and all Europeans are four hours distant.
Mahdi has put Saleh Pasha (of Shaggyeh) in
chains.</p>

<p>Twenty-six goats came kindly into lines to-day.</p>

<p>I am very anxious about the <i>Abbas</i>; it would be
terrible, if it is true, that she is captured.</p>

<p>The cut out pages are, or rather were, a tirade
against the cession of Kassala,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c., but as they
would be no use now I have cut them out.</p>

<p>I believe Government can, now-a-days, get men
to do anything by means of money and honours
(<i>not honour</i>), and I have a shrewd idea of how this
affair will end up here. However, it is not my
affair, and I have taken my decision.</p>

<p>Kitchener to Chermside. “He is furious about
that admirable treaty of Hewitt’s. Fortunate I did
not tell him about it. He has the Mahdi alongside
now, and can vent his spleen on him. We
have got his steamers all but two, and need not
care.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>Admirable treaty, let us think&mdash;yes, spread of
Christianity, regular missionary movement, ancient
Christian Church and people...! get me up a
<i>précis</i> of this history of Abyssinia, but not that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of Bruce which speaks of ravages committed by the
Abyssinian army on the march. Hewitt, charmed
with His Majesty, calls the Queen his mother, &amp;c.
Now, if we can <i>only get</i> that Mahdi to make a treaty
we are safe for six months. Enough for the day is
its evil. I declare I am becoming a missionary
myself with my quotations and acts.</p>

<p>Graham would be angry if I criticised his
despatch, which Slatin sent me. The <i>Raumer</i><a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
seems an excellent weapon.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 22.</i>&mdash;It is suspected that the two men
who came with letters from Saleh Bey of Galabat
are spies of the Mahdi, into whose hands has fallen
the letter King John wrote to me; these men came
in a very circuitous way from the direction of the
Mahdi’s camp.</p>

<p>Another soldier and a slave came in from the
Arabs just now.</p>

<p>King John and the Mahdi both force men to
change their religion; both cut off lips of smokers
and noses of <i>snuffers</i>; both are fanatics and
robbers.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Mahdi has got King John’s letter to me,
he knows all about the famous, or rather infamous,
Hewitt Treaty, which is a trouble. Slatin’s letter
mentions the ‘Rapport Militaire’; it seems odd
he should have known it was on board, unless the
<i>Abbas</i> was captured; yet we have two men who
declare she passed down. Perhaps the captured
Greeks knew of the existence of this famous journal,
and told the Arabs of it, or Awaan may have
written it; it is odd he (Slatin) says nothing of
Power and Herbin.</p>

<p>House of Lords ... in answer to questions put
by the ... of ... replied that the noble marquis
seemed to take a special delight in asking questions
which he knew he ( ... ) could not answer. He
could say he had given a deal of time and attention
to the affairs of the Soudan, but he frankly acknowledged
that the names of places and people were so
mixed up, that it was impossible to get a true view
of the case (a laugh). The noble marquis asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
what the policy of Her Majesty’s Government was?
It was as if he asked the policy of a log floating
down stream; it was going to the sea, as any one
who had an ounce of brains could see. Well, that
was the policy of it, only it was a decided policy,
and a straightforward one to drift along and take
advantage of every circumstance. His lordship
deprecated the frequent questioning on subjects
which, as his lordship had said, he knew nothing
about, and further did not care to know anything
about.</p>

<p>... to ... Why, I did my best to keep the
Hewitt Treaty secret from him. It is no use blaming
me. I knew from his telegram he would make a
noise about it, and I told Kitchener not to say a
word about it. It is that brute Mitzakis who let the
cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>A man came in from the Mahdi’s camp, who left
this fourteen days ago with my permission to go to
the Arabs. He now comes back to see his family
in Kartoum. I have told him,&mdash;<i>once out, there is no
return!</i> He is a cool fellow.</p>

<p>The Major wounded at Bourré the other day
is dead.</p>

<p>The two men who brought letters from Saleh
Bey of Galabat do not like going out on the North
Front side; they want to go out by the West
side, <i>i.e.</i> where the Mahdi’s camp is.</p>

<p>I believe that the Hewitt Treaty will be a
complete dead letter, for the Greek Consul says<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
the Admiral gave him (King John) no money,
so what was the use of the treaty. I expect
King John wrote to me to ask me to give
him the taxes of the country ceded, quoting the
treaty of Hewitt. As for the King or his men
ever leaving their hills, it is out of the question.
He might have made a move had he been given
£100,000, but no chance of his doing so when he
has nothing but this paper treaty. The only place
the King could possibly occupy is Senheit, and I
doubt his doing that permanently. He will drive
out the Roman Catholic Mission at once<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> (part
of his missionary movement); the occupation of
Senheit just cuts off the safe road from Massowah
to Kassala. I declare it is amusing to see what
shifts Her Majesty’s Government have been put to
get out of their mess.</p>

<p>A slave has come in to Omdurman with another
letter from the Arabs. I shall stop this fun for the
future.</p>

<p>I feel sure King John gave Admiral Hewitt a
spear and shield and the Order of Solomon&mdash;vanity
of vanities&mdash;for the treaty, and I feel also sure we
shall see no Abyssinian army in the Soudan. The
King will write, or has written, a haughty letter,
saying that his mother, the Queen, has given him,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and he requests I will send in the taxes <i>at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
once</i>, otherwise he will advance. All T.,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and we
shall hear no more of His Majesty except groans
at my perfidy in not sending the taxes. He is a
hopeless sort of man, and never is worth considering.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Her Majesty’s Government will say: “We
made the treaty; it is not our fault His Majesty
did not carry it out, on paper; Kassala and all the
other places are now under King John, and consequently
quite safe.” The treaty is worth as much
as any treaty made now giving Kordofan to any
one!<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>We need now only a treaty with the Mahdi about
the garrisons, and then Her Majesty’s Government
will sleep in peace: <i>their work is done</i>. I only say
I will have no confidence in any such treaty, and
shall take my precautions accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Letters have come in: one says Lupton Bey has
surrendered (Appendix U, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>), and has been
appointed Governor of Bahr Gazelle with an adherent
of the Mahdi. Another says that he has brought
slaves to the Mahdi, and hopes to buy horses with
the products of their sale.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The Mahdi’s letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
is to relate how he captured the post,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> &amp;c., <i>Abbas</i>,
&amp;c. My answer<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> was, that I did not care who
had surrendered and who had been captured. As
for these letters, I cannot make head nor tail of
them, so I leave them to the Arabic scholars of the
Universities.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 23.</i>&mdash;(What a fearful scrawl!) Ten
soldiers, with six women came in this morning to
Omdurman. I have sifted out the Mahdi’s letter<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
respecting the capture of the <i>Abbas</i>, and do not
believe it; the papers he sent me as being captured
in the <i>Abbas</i> were never in the <i>Abbas</i>, they
were taken from a spy I sent out from here, the
same man who brought me the news from Dongola
of the British advance. He had a bad eye
(ophthalmia), and was caught at Metemma and
killed, having, when drunk, let out that he had
come from me.</p>

<p>The nuns had to walk all the way from Kordofan.
The Mahdi has 15,000 head of cattle with him.
The Arabs are dying in great numbers from dysentery.
The village of Hogali opposite the palace
is levelled. It may not be generally known, but
by the Firman which named Towfik, there is an
express injunction that no part of the Egyptian
territory is to be ceded, except by permission of
the Porte. Also by the Treaty of Paris, and also
by that of Berlin, the integrity of the Ottoman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Dominion is guaranteed by the Powers. What a
farce it is to say Egypt ceded Kassala!</p>

<p>The escaped party, I mentioned as having come
in, have arrived at the Palace, nine soldiers, eight
women, and two slaves, all old friends, also a <i>baby</i>!
They say the Mahdi started with 40,000 Arabs and
1500 Regulars from Kordofan, that he has not now
more than 5000 or 6000 Arabs, and 1000 soldiers
(500 ran away), that they have no Dhoora, only
35 boxes (35,000 rds.) Remington cartridges, and
50 shells; they say the other soldiers want to come
in, either to-day or to-morrow. The Mahdi says
he will go against the English and will not stop at
Kartoum. The whole gang were shown themselves
in the mirrors. Such a display of ivories was never
seen. The baby danced with delight, at seeing
itself, <i>for the first time</i>, it was like a black slug.
The <i>mother</i> was, of course, delighted.</p>

<p>The Arab horsemen cut the telegraph which goes
out of the lines at Bourré to the North Fort. I
declined to allow its repair since I had lost a major
and had six men wounded when last we went out of
the lines, and besides which I had another cable to
the north side. No sentries at the North Fort or
Bourré, or on the Mudirat; these people are enough
to break any one’s heart. Fortunately, from the roof
of the Palace one watches all these things, and can
bully them into obeying orders, but it is (as Hansall
says<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>) a <i>vie abrutissante</i>, to be always snarling and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
growling. The <i>Ismailia</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i> went down
the river, and saw no Arabs on either bank. If
these Arabs (one’s servants) are not <i>eating</i>, they are
<i>saying</i> their <i>prayers</i>; if not <i>saying their prayers</i>, they
are <i>sleeping</i>; if not <i>sleeping</i>, they are <i>sick</i>. One
snatches at them at intervals. Now figure to yourself
the position; you cannot do anything with
them while in these fortresses <i>eating</i>, <i>saying prayers</i>,
<i>sleeping</i>, or <i>sick</i>, and they know it. You would be
a brute if you did (which I fear I often am). You
want to send an immediate order, and there is your
servant bobbing up and down, and you cannot
disturb him. It is a beautiful country for trying
experiments with your patience.</p>

<p>It is very curious, but if I am in a bad temper,
which I fear is often the case, my servants will be
always at their prayers, and thus religious practices
follow the scale of my temper; they are pagans if
all goes well.</p>

<p>I must say I hate our diplomatists.
I think with few exceptions they are arrant humbugs,
and I expect they know it. I include the
Colvin class. The Rothschilds are, I feel assured,
giving Her Majesty’s Government a lot of bother
about the Finance Question. If you had asked ...
at Balaklava the price of a cheese, he would have
said £5 5<i>s.</i> If you asked him now you would
offend him.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 24.</i>&mdash;Arab church parade. Mahomet
Achmet and Faki Mustapha, few in number, at
Waled a Goun, the Arabs have divided their camp,
putting the regulars near the river, in camp apart
from theirs, to act as buffers if any attack is made
on them.</p>

<p>The Arabs have got a nuggar at Giraffe. A man
of Zubair’s old force has come in from the Arabs.
To-morrow expires the six months for which the
notes were issued. We have been boxed up 226
days (seven and a half months); siege of Troy.</p>

<p>The man who came in (Zubair’s old soldier) was
one of Lupton’s men from the Bahr Gazelle; he
left five months ago (Bahr Gazelle). He says
Lupton is at Shaka, and is Sheikh Abdullah, so he
has changed his religion.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> I wonder what has
become of the garrison of the Equator. Another
man has come in.</p>

<p>All that bloodshed in fighting the slave dealers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the Bahr Gazelle has gone, apparently, for nothing!<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
There are great doubts if the Mahdi is really near,
no one appears to have seen him.</p>

<p>Since the escape of the lot yesterday, the Arabs
have taken the rifles of the regulars from them: at
the Mahdi’s camp, the Arabs have a ferry under our
nose, across the White Nile; but I do not like to send
up the steamers, for the captains are so heedless.</p>

<p>I calculated that the advance force of troops
arrived at Wady Halfa on 22nd September,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> that
they took twenty days from there to Debbeh, so
that on 12th October they were at Debbeh (Stewart
(<i>D.V.</i>) arrived at Debbeh on 28th September), and
I calculate they could not be at Metemma&mdash;Shendy&mdash;before
10th November, which will give them
twenty-nine days for 150 miles, thence it is five
days here for a steamer, so that 15th November
ought to see them or their advance guard.</p>

<p class="pc1">Extracts from Appendix R.<br />
<i>La Route de Souakim à Berber.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">Avant que la bataille de Tamai eut été livrée et gagnée,
le Général Herbert Stewart, sinon les généraux Graham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
et Buller, avaient étudié avec soin la question de savoir si
les troupes, ou une partie des troupes, pouvaient marcher
jusqu’à Berber <i>pour aider Gordon à réprimer les partisans
du Mahdi dans la région du Nil</i>. Cette proposition semblait
alors si convenable que l’état des troupes les mieux
adaptées à une semblable expédition, les dispositions pour
les approvisionnements, l’équipement, les chevaux disponibles,
etc., avaient été l’objet de l’étude journalière des
officiers. On se souviendra qu’après Tamai, la cavalerie se
transporta aux puits d’Handouk, à huit milles de Souakim.
On croyait généralement, alors, que cette marche en avant
n’était que la première étape d’un mouvement sur Berber
d’une force montée. Pour empêcher toute souffrance provenant
d’une disette d’eau, l’effectif ne devait pas être de
plus de 500 hommes de cavalerie; aucune infanterie ne
devait faire partie de l’expédition. Il était en outre
entendu, qu’en cas de nécessité, un semblable effectif pourrait
suivre un jour ou deux après et trouverait également,
dans les puits, de l’eau en abondance. Le fait est que les
généraux Graham, Buller, Stewart, les colonels Clery,
Taylor, et d’autres, semblaient ne pas mettre en doute, si
l’ordre en était donné, qu’une succession de détachements,
forts chacun de 500 hommes, pourrait être rapidement
poussée sur Berber. Le bruit de ce qui se passait parvint
rapidement aux oreilles de nos hommes qui étaient à la
Zariba d’Handouk, et la plupart des troupiers manifestèrent
un désir intense de prendre part à l’expédition. On savait
que le Général Stewart avait soumis ses plans pour la
marche en avant au Général Graham, et que ce dernier,
ainsi que l’Amiral Hewett, les avait recommandés au gouvernement.
<i>Les jours se succédèrent, mais l’ordre du départ
n’arrivait pas: quelque empressés de partir que fussent beaucoup
d’hommes, si nous avions connu alors la position exacte
de Gordon, on eût manifesté beaucoup plus d’anxiété pour
l’ordre du départ.</i> Lorsque cette question était discutée,
question qui au moment occupait pleinement nos pensées,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
entre officiers supérieurs, ils exprimaient l’étonnement que
l’ordre fut tant retardé, et que le Gouvernement hésitât
davantage. <i>On n’arrivait qu’à une seule conclusion, c’était
que la position du Général Gordon était telle qu’il n’avait pas
besoin d’aide de troupes britanniques venant de Souakim.</i>
Quoi qu’en ait pu penser, après réflexion, le Général
Graham, de la possibilité d’envoyer une troupe de cavalerie
forte de 500 hommes, en mars dernier, de Souakim à Berber,
je suis certain que lui et la plupart des officiers sous ses
ordres croyaient alors que c’était une chose sage et guerrière
à entreprendre. Nous nous apercevons tous trop tard, que
cette simple expédition eût sauvé Berber, Khartoum et
Gordon au vrai cœur.</p></div>

<p class="p1">If they do not come before 30th November the
game is up, and Rule Britannia. In this calculation
I have given every latitude for difficulties of transport,
making forts, &amp;c., and on the 15th November
I ought to see Her Majesty’s uniform. I suppose
a part of the force will go to attack Berber on the
10th November (when I calculate they will be at
Metemma&mdash;Shendy), and that a small party will
come on here; so we have now 7 days in October
and 15 days in November to wait = 22 days&mdash;three
weeks to add to the 226 days we have already
passed, owing to Baring (who I shall remember)
and his peace manœuvres. One of the papers
Slatin sent to me, says that Graham was willing
to send men to Berber, and could have done it;
but Evelyn would not give the order. I asked
only for 200 men to be sent there (vide my telegram
in Stewart’s Journal). I take Slatin’s paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
out of Appendix R, and put it on the other side.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
I do not know the date, but I declare that, if my
telegrams to Baring are made known, it will be
proved Baring knew up to the 12th March the
exact position of affairs up here; and therefore, if
there was an impression abroad that I did not say,
“Send troops (200) to Berber,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> or you will lose
it,” he must have suppressed my telegrams.</p>

<p>I dwell on the joy of never seeing Great Britain
again, with its horrid, wearisome <i>dinner</i> parties and
miseries.  How we can put up with those things
passes my imagination!  It is a perfect bondage.
At those dinner parties we are all in masks, saying
what we do not believe, eating and drinking things
we do not want, and then abusing one another. I
would sooner live like a Dervish with the Mahdi,
than go out to dinner every night in London. I
hope, if any English general comes to Kartoum, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
will not ask me to dinner. Why men cannot be
friends without bringing the wretched stomachs in,
is astounding.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 25.</i>&mdash;Three men came in from Waled a
Goun; one I sent out again, as I think he is a spy,
the other reports that the small captured steamer
<i>Mahomet Ali</i> will be down at Giraffe with twelve
boat loads of grain, either to-day or to-morrow. I
do not even attempt to stop it; for if the expeditionary
force arrives, we will capture it; I cannot
risk steamers against land guns.</p>

<p>Two soldiers came in from the Arabs at Omdurman
with their rifles.</p>

<p>A lot of people are moving from the right bank
of Nile, towards the Sheikh el Obeyed’s (the <i>man</i>
not the <i>city</i>). Are they leaving on account of the
advance of the troops? or is it for offensive purposes?
or is it a raid which is returning from pillage?
We sent up the steamers and stopped the Arab
ferry near the lines. The Arabs are retaliating by
putting a gun or two in the old place near the
large tree (el Sheddarah). The Arabs fired four
shells at the steamers. Soldiers at Omdurman
captured two cows, and killed two others. Another
slave came in at Omdurman. Yesterday some cows
were captured near the South Lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

         title="" />
</div>

<p>What would be the best plan of attacking the
Arabs? The object is to give them such a crushing
defeat as will put an end to the fighting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
prevent them rallying on Kordofan. The position
is thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. I would attack Waled a Goun at A, and I
would cut off his retreat by the sending up
steamers to Duem with a small force; the Mahdi’s
force and Sheikh el Obeyed’s force would look on.</p>

<p>2. At the same time I would attack the post at
Giraffe. Both operations on the same day with the
following troops.</p>

<p><i>Operations on White Nile.</i>&mdash;To proceed up the
White Nile by boats, 2000 B. infantry to point X.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
To proceed along the White Nile, right bank,
the cavalry you may have to point X. To occupy
with two guns and 1500 men simultaneously the
two villages outside the lines, with the Soudan
troops, the troops not to advance, only to threaten,
houses loop-holed, &amp;c. Three steamers to accompany
the force.</p>

<p><i>Operations on Blue Nile.</i>&mdash;To proceed up the
Blue Nile or along the bank, 1000 B. infantry, accompanied
by steamers and boats, with the Shaggyeh
horsemen, some 80, and 1000 men of Soudan
troops to Giraffe.</p>

<p>If these operations are successful, then 800 men
with four steamers to pursue up the river to Duem.</p>

<p><i>Expedition towards Sennaar.</i>&mdash;The Sheikh el
Obeyed will probably surrender at once, then a
force of 500 B. I. and 1000 Soudan infantry should
go up river to Wad el Medinet, and open the
route to Sennaar (while men are sent up to buy
corn with them). There appear to be no Arabs in
arms between Wad el Medinet and Sennaar, or
south of Sennaar. (The Mahdi will at once retreat
to Obeyed, <i>the city</i>.) This expedition will probably
be met at Abou Haraz by the surrender of Katarif
and all that district, and thus the route to Katarif
and Kassala will be opened.</p>

<p>These operations will entail the very smallest
amount of marching on the troops, and would be
completed in three weeks or less.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in all these engagements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in the Soudan no quarter on either side has
been given, so it must not be expected that the
Soudan troops will give it now if you come; also
with respect to the wounded Arabs, if you go and
help them, they will (like the Afghans) try and kill
your men who make the effort; they are very
treacherous, and, worked up by religious frenzy,
they think&mdash;1. That you only pretend to help them,
in order to kill them afterwards; 2. That, being
desperate, they think to enter Paradise if they kill
an infidel. It seems rather cold-blooded to write
this, but it is the character of those whom you are
to fight. For my part, I hope they will all run
away, for they are only dupes ninety-nine out of
every hundred; it is the leaders who are the prime
movers. I would give the lives to the leaders if
they ask pardon; but I would send them all to
Mecca to study Mahdism under the Orthodox. No
information as yet as to the meaning of the caravan,
&amp;c., which left the Nile to go towards the
Sheikh el Obeyed. One of our boats, which was
collecting grass down below Halfeyeh, must needs
land its crew and try and take some cattle of the
caravan. The Arabs turned on them, and killed
the Reis. Crew says they killed a lot of Arabs (?).
I think these people do really love fighting, if there
is the least chance of plunder.</p>

<p>King John (according to the Greek consul) is to
be allowed to import arms at Massowah. He will
never do it, for he has not money to buy them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>If the Mahdi has got the Bahr Gazelle, and we
evacuate the Soudan in his favour, the Anti-Slavery
Society may as well close their office as to the
suppression of the slave-trade in these parts, especially
if we leave him the steamers.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Special Commission, House of Lords.... under
examination, Q. 2389. Did your Lordship know,
when in Cairo, that the Fellaheen were being
dragged in chains, from their houses, to go and fight
the Mahdi, under Hicks, and what steps did you
take to prevent it?<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Did you inform Her Majesty’s
Government of the facts, and what was their answer?</p>

<p>The Mahdi has moved his ferry higher up river
since our steamers went up this morning.</p>

<p>It is a great question of doubt to me, if Public
Officials ought to so sink their personality, as to allow
themselves to overlook facts, which must strike
them, as being not only evil, but also detrimental to
our national interests, merely because such facts are
likely to be disagreeable to our Government in
requiring them to decide on difficult questions.
... did know of this forced conscription, and so did....
Did they not see that, to allow such conscripts
to go up to the Soudan, was not only cruel, but also
politically unwise, for it could not be expected that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
they would have any heart in the matter? If they
had stopped it, Hicks would have never left Kartoum,
and his army would not have been annihilated;
for it is the defeat of Hicks which gave
the Mahdi his great prestige. He had annihilated
detachments <i>before that: after that</i> he had crushed
a huge army. See what it has led to! There are
times when men like ... ought to obey, and there
are times when they ought to disobey or else resign.
Now, if ... had only hinted his resignation, the
Governments were so placed as to be obliged to
listen to him. I have a strong suspicion ... did
know how to act. It was ... and a wish to be
agreeable to Her Majesty’s Government which
prevented him acting according to his own ideas.
Sometimes it is the height of unkindness to be too
kind and amiable, and this is one of those cases.
History may be misty about it (will not know the
thimble the pea is under, for the cards are well
shuffled), but there is no doubt that ... had the
destinies of Egypt and of the Soudan in his hands,
<i>far more than Her Majesty’s Government</i>, and he
did not succeed. His amiability did for him. It is
<i>not insubordinate</i> to resign, if you do not agree
to a policy, or feel you cannot carry it out with
a whole heart.  In military affairs it is different;
one is ordered to go here and there, and one obeys
(even if one thinks it is unwise, having represented
it), but in Diplomacy there is no such call, and
certainly there was none in the case of ... who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
only an amateur in the Foreign Office Service, an
outsider. Had ... when he came to Egypt cut
down the rate of interest by a swoop of his pen to
3½ per cent., who would have said a word; but now
it is the difficulty. There would have been a
fearful howl from the bondholders, but that would
have been all. He dismissed the Control (under
the <i>cover</i> of Towfik), and could have reduced the
interest, and he would have gained the sympathy of
all the people. Hicks (who, by the way, never
wanted to go to the Soudan) would have held his
own at Kartoum, and have worn out the Mahdi,
and we would have had none of this late work.
I am afraid to say what numbers have been killed
through this present policy, certainly some 80,000;
and it is not yet over. For my part, I hope they
will all run away. We have in a most effectual
way restored the slave-trade and slave-hunting,
for Her Majesty’s Government cannot keep the
Soudan, and never will Egypt be able to govern it.
The only thing to be done, is to give it to the
Sultan. What an end to diplomacy of Her
Majesty’s Government: and it was so easy when I
left in January, 1880, to have settled it quietly,
<i>giving up Kordofan, Darfur</i>, and <i>Bahr Gazelle</i>, and
<i>Equator</i>, with decency and quiet.</p>

<p>I declare I do not see how we will get out of it
(the Soudan) even now; allow that you come to
Kartoum, that you drive off the Arabs, open the
road to Sennaar. What are you going to do?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
You will say, “Take out those who wish to leave.”
Well, you begin with Sennaar, and of course will
have to fight all the way down. It will take three
months. During those three months, how are you
to feed Kartoum? for the moment you leave
Sennaar you leave your granary. You get to
Kartoum, you are face to face with 30,000 people
who will not leave, and who are hedging with the
Mahdi; and with 3000 Shaggyeh, all armed. You
fight your way to Berber; another three months,
you have no food at Berber; then it will need
another two months to get to Dongola, which (seeing
your policy) will be hostile. It is indeed a terrible
problem, and I wish I could see my way out of it.</p>

<p>Then you come into the hot months, and low
Nile. This time <i>next year</i> will not see you out of
the Soudan, with decency. Of course you can go
back now, but what was the use of coming? <i>I will
not allow that you came for</i> <span class="smcap">me</span>. <i>You came for the
garrisons of the Soudan.</i> Now, by the Turkish
arrangement, if you act promptly, you can get away
quietly in January, 1885. It will not cost anything
like what it will cost you to keep your troops here
for a year, as I fear you must do if you persevere in
trying a “<i>rapid retreat</i>.”</p>

<p>I can have no object in this advice. I want to
get out of the affair, but with decency. I regret the
necessity of an expedition, but if once you come to
Berber, and communicate with Kartoum, if you
stick to the “<i>rapid retreat</i>.” you will not be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
accomplish it, and you are in for a year’s stay.
While, on the other hand, the giving of country to
Turks enables you to get away with credit. Let
Her Majesty’s Government <i>find excuses</i> for it, it will
not be difficult for <i>them</i>. Put yourself in my position
if you say “<i>rapid retreat, and leave Sennaar to its
fate</i>.” I will say “<i>No, I would sooner die first</i>,” and
will resign my commission, for I could not do it. If
you say, “<i>Then you are no longer</i> Governor-General,”
then I am all right, and all the responsibility is on
you (for I could not be supposed, if you turn me out
of Governor-General, to be obliged to aid such a
movement, which I think is disgraceful). You will
then be face to face with the people. I do not say
but that Abdel Kader might not aid in the “<i>rapid
retreat</i>” better than I could, even if I agreed to it
(of this you can judge for yourself, at any rate I shall
be out of it, and of my engagement to the people).</p>

<p>It may be that all this writing is unnecessary, and
that you have other views, but it is as well you
know my opinions. <i>I am secure against any loss, by
the King of the Belgians, if I leave H.M.S., therefore
I am, so to say, free of H.M.S. If you turn me out
of Governor-General I am relieved from all responsibility,
as to your action in Soudan, towards the
people.</i> I do not think I am insubordinate in this
matter, nor unreasonable. I do not say I would
not give <i>all my services in a subordinate position</i> to
aid you, but it would be against my grain and be
very distasteful, and must <span class="smcap">not</span> be in <span class="smcap">position</span> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Governor-General</span>, that must be a <i>sine quâ non</i>,
and it must be known that I disapprove of the
“<i>rapid retreat</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> I would not say this if I was not
convinced that the “<i>rapid retreat</i>” is an operation
of such difficulty as to make every Englishman
akin, and bound to aid one another. If I was Lord
Wolseley <i>I would make</i> Her Majesty’s Government
send the Turks here.</p>

<p>I do not advocate the keeping of the Soudan by
us, it is a useless possession, and we could not govern
it, neither can Egypt (after the late events). I am
only discussing how <i>to get out of it</i> in <i>honour and in
the cheapest way</i> (we must remember we caused its
troubles), and that way is, either by some sort of
provisional Government under Zubair, or by giving
it to the Turks; it is simply a question of <span class="smcap">getting
out of it</span> with decency. Zubair would square the
Shaggyeh and townspeople and arrange with the
Mahdi, and you could get away. He might hold
his own if you gave the Mahdi a good defeat ere
you left; at any rate it is only by Zubair or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Turks you will get out of the Soudan before November
1885!!!!!</p>

<p>The Turks are the best solution, though most
expensive. <i>They would keep the Soudan</i>: give them
£2,000,000. The next best is Zubair with £500,000,
and £100,000 a year for two years; he will keep
the Soudan <i>for a time</i>. (In both cases slave trade
will flourish), thus you will be quiet in Egypt, and
will be able to <i>retreat to Egypt in January, 1885.
If you do not do this</i>, then be prepared for a <i>deal
of worry and danger</i>, and your campaign will be
<i>entirely unprofitable and devoid of prestige</i>,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> for the
day after you leave Kartoum the Mahdi will walk
in and say he drove you out, which is not pleasant
in India or elsewhere.</p>

<p>In discussing this question I have entirely put
my own peculiar views out of the question: to give
up countries which are to some degree civilised,
which, if properly governed, are quiet and orderly,
to the Turks or to Zubair, and to allow of the
slave trade to flourish again in tenfold intensity, is
not a very high <i>rôle</i>, but <i>quoi faire</i>? We have not
the men to govern these lands, we cannot afford the
money; consequently, I advise what I have said.
When I left the Soudan it was quiet and covered
its expenses, and there was no bother to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
continued to have governed it. Now it is different,
and would need an outlay which our Government
will not give. (It is because the cloth is short I
recommend the shape of coat to be such.)</p>

<p>It would be nobler to keep the Soudan, but it is
too much to expect our taxpayers to agree to (and
besides which, ‘Plutarch’s Lives’ are no longer in
vogue, and “<i>you must pay me well ere I go to the
Soudan</i>” is the idea). The Soudan could (if cut
off from excrescences) be made to pay its expenses,
but it would need a <i>dictator</i>, and I would not take
the post if offered to me.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 26.</i>&mdash;Three women came in from Waled a
Goun. The idea is gaining ground that the Mahdi
is dead, and that his Vakeel is acting his part.
The Arabs are thinking of placing a station at
Kerowé.</p>

<p>Yesterday week was the anniversary of Hicks’s
defeat, 1st November, 1883, though I believe it went
on for three days, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd November.</p>

<p>The Arabs have brought a gun nearer Bourré to-day,
probably emboldened by absence of the steamers.
Two lieutenants, one sergeant-major, two serjeants,
one soldier, and one slave came into Omdurman
from the Arab camp. They say the Mahdi is alive;
with him are Saleh Pasha, in chains, Hussein Pasha
Khalifa, Elias Pasha, and all the Europeans. They
heard a report (now some days old) that the Expeditionary
Force was two days distant from Berber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
The two lieutenants were with Hicks; they say
the army died of thirst, and scarcely fought at all.
With the Mahdi are 5000 men, of which 1000
are black troops, 150 are Egyptian troops. What
little weight do engineers place on the existence of
populations in fortresses, yet this existence is all-important;
more so than the works. Malta and
Gibraltar are weak, because of their civil population.</p>

<p>The Arabs have a big tent at Giraffe this evening.
The lieutenants who came in say the Mahdi will
try and place a station in the place we drove
them out of&mdash;on the North Front&mdash;in August last,
just before our defeat at El foun. Goba, with the
exception of Mahomed Seyd Osman’s house and
the Mosque, is destroyed. Salaam Pasha’s is
nearly so.</p>

<p>8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;Two slaves have come into Omdurman.
They say “<i>the regulars</i> in the camp of Mahomet
Achmet, <i>the Mahdi, went this afternoon</i> to the Dem,
or camp of <i>Faki Mustapha</i>, and looted it, firing on
the soldiers of Faki Mustapha, who resisted the
plundering.” I fear it is all fudge.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 27.</i>&mdash;One sergeant-major and two slaves
came into Omdurman this morning. Sent out two
spies towards Shendy.</p>

<p>One thing which (although spiteful) would cause
me intense pleasure if the “<i>rapid retreat</i>” is carried
out, is that the English would just walk into those
Shaggyeh and Bashi Bazouks, and bundle them all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
out, and thus pay them out for the worry they have
given me, and for their meanness.</p>

<p>If the Turks come here, you would have scarcely
anyone to send down, and you would hand over the
Shaggyeh and Bashi Bazouks to the Turks, and all
the Divans, &amp;c. Nothing then could be better for
you than to get the Turks here. You would get off
all responsibility of Kassala and Sennaar, and you
would let the Turks and the King of Abyssinia
settle about the <i>Hewitt Treaty</i>. You would also
get off the bother of the Equator and Bahr Gazelle,
if it has not fallen.</p>

<p>You would know exactly what sum you had to
pay, and save no end of expense and time and
vexation with regard to the settlement of claims.
Remember that Baring authorised me to draw more
than £100,000; indeed, he said, “Such sum as you
need.” So you are responsible for paper-money
issued.</p>

<p>You would make up with the Sultan, and, as for
giving up Suakin and Massowah to the Turks it is
nothing; for those ports are useless, except as ports
of the Soudan, and would be a bother to you to
keep, if the Mahdi has the Soudan. You would be
always in strict blockade on land side.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>The more I think of it the more the Turk
solution appears Hobson’s choice. I can see no
option, unless, ere you arrived at Kartoum, Kartoum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
fell, and then, even, it would not look well to
go back from Berber, while that even would be
dangerous to some degree; for the Dongola people
would see you meant to evacuate, and would be
hostile. You have gone so far and spent so much
that I cannot see anything for it but to go on. And
the Turks are the only solution which affords the
certainty of being able to stop. I get out of all my
troubles if the Turks come, for I shunt them on the
Turks, and so do you. The idea is that when the
English come here the Arabs will bolt.</p>

<p>Stewart’s servant, Macktar, must needs go and
marry another wife. How they can go on like this,
marrying and giving in marriage, when one can
never say, that to-morrow is our own, is wonderful.
Tangi has taken two wives up here!</p>

<p>The Government shall not get out of the desertion
of Kassala (if they take cover under the
Hewitt Treaty and say, “we arranged with the
King of Abyssinia to look after that country”), if
they do desert it, for the King will never move,
and all who have ever known anything of Abyssinia
must know he can never move. There is a report
in town that Slatin has been put in chains. I should
not be at all surprised.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major, soldiers, and two men,
Shaggyeh, who came in to-day, say that Slatin is
not a prisoner. The sergeant-major states that one
of our soldiers escaped from Omdurman three days
ago. On inquiry, I find that it is true, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
officer in command never reported it. The sergeant-major
says the Arabs meditate an attack on Omdurman,
in consequence of what the deserter told them.
This is the <i>fourth</i> desertion since March that I
know of, and it is the <i>first</i> desertion among the
soldiers (with saving clause) that I know of. Arabs
fired on the Santels<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> at the end of the lines on the
White Nile, and struck one. The Arabs fired
fourteen times with Krupp guns; they retired when
we fired twice on them; they fired from their old
battery near the Tree “el Sheddarah.” Some
time ago I gave Ferratch Pasha £100 a month,
and I afterwards made him a Ferile, or General of
Division, for political reasons. He had the cheek
to ask me to give him £150 a month (the sum I
used to give the Seraskier or Commander-in-Chief
in the Soudan in old times, but which was £50
beyond regulation). He put in an application a few
days ago for the £150, and forage for eight horses!
Quite ignoring the state of the Dhoora exchequer,
I said, “Wait.” He was foolish enough to renew
the application, which I tore up. He may go to
the Arabs if he likes. The Arabs appear to be
passing the Blue Nile at Giraffe, they may be going
to place a post at Halfeyeh, the Sheikh el Obeyed
refusing to send his men there, we shall see to-morrow.
It is not from any feeling of respect to
the people up here that I urge their relief, but it
is because they are such a weak selfish lot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
because their qualities do not affect the question
of our duties to them. The Redemption would
never have taken place if it had depended on our
merits.</p>

<p>I must say I rather revel at the thought of the
dismay which will attend the reduction of salaries
to quarter their present rate, they have been so
very selfish about these things. I believe if the
Mahdi would only give them half the present rate,
they would go to the Mahdi, but the Mahdi’s service
is <i>gratuitous</i>, so there is no fear of that. I go out, a
black Bashi Bazouk addresses me on the inadequacy
of his pay and rations. I whisper to him, “<i>Go to
Sheikh el Obeyed</i>,” he grins and evaporates. I do
not care a bit now. We must either be relieved,
or fall, before the end of November, or at the end
of November. I am meditating the sending down
of “<i>Husseinyeh</i>” with this post; if the Arabs come
to Halfeyeh I then cut off all hopes of our escape,
for the <i>Ismailia</i> steamer would not be fit to go
down to Berber. The financial affairs up here will
be a precious job.</p>

<p>It amuses me to find people here holding on
to the delusion that the old state of affairs is likely
to come back as to the Government, and saying,
“You are going to stay with us as Governor-General,
and things are to be as of old.” I answer,
“I would not take you again at any price after
your meanness.” They say, “Oh, yes, the people
are not well behaved, &amp;c., &amp;c., but you will stay <i>for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the glory of God</i>” (<i>i.e.</i> our interests). They are an
amusing lot: Allah on lips, self interest at heart,
and such self interest, as is <i>positively naked</i>, and
they even laugh at it.</p>

<p>A soldier and a slave came in to-night to Omdurman.
They say the Mahdi is undecided what
to do. The regulars with the Mahdi have been
robbing the Arabs, so the Mahdi has taken away
their arms.</p>

<p>Spy in from Sennaar fifteen days ago with letters,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
which say Sennaar is all right. This was in answer
to a letter I sent to Sennaar saying, “Expedition
was on its way to relieve the <i>garrisons, so Sennaar
depends on me to see after it</i>.”</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 28.</i>&mdash;The man who came from Sennaar
says the Mahdi has ordered all the Arabs to congregate
at Kartoum from all parts. Sheikh el
Obeyed has made a station close to Giraffe, on
right bank of Blue Nile. They have two boats
plying across the river, taking corn from Sheikh
el Obeyed to Waled a Goun. Arabs had a reconnoitring
party in the ruins of Omdurman village this
morning.</p>

<p>One lieutenant, one sergeant-major, four soldiers,
and one boatman came in this morning from the
Arabs at Omdurman. Rumour says the steamers
have been looting Shendy (I hope that it will be
remembered none of the Egyptian soldiers, officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
or Pashas are to come up here again). The boatman
left Berber six days ago. He says the Arabs
at Berber have sent the captured money, &amp;c.,
of Berber into the desert; that Seyd Mahomet
Osman, with a mixed force, were two days’ march
from El Damer; that the five steamers have brought
Shendy, &amp;c., into subjection; that the road from
here to Shendy is free of Arabs, who have gone
into the desert; that only in a certain district <i>near</i>,
but <i>higher up</i> than Shoboloha, there are marauding
Arabs, but no great number; that the <i>Abbas</i>
passed down safely; that the two boats which had
wood in them alone were captured, being abandoned
on being emptied; that at Dar Djumna
a sheikh pretended to be friendly, and tried to
capture the steamer, which fired on the Arabs, and
killed a lot; that three spies from Seyd Mahomet
Osman were captured trying to communicate with
Dongola, and were executed; that <i>a man went
with a camel from Berber to Dar Djumna, and
came back in one day</i>; that the expeditionary force is
at Dar Djumna. The officer reports the Mahdi most
undecided, one hour disarming the regulars, and at
another hour arming them; the Arabs deserting,
and others joining the Mahdi day after day.</p>

<p>A mine was exploded by a man on the North
side, and I hear he is dangerously wounded, if not
dead. On questioning the boatman again he explained
the <i>Dar Djumna</i> is not the cataract, but is
a place (near the cataract, just below Berber) one-and-a-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
days from Berber. They, the expeditionary
force, had eight steamers (one, the old
screw boat of Dongola, I had towed up from Wady
Halfa in 1878). The man said the <i>Abbas</i> went on
to Dongola (why was it not sent up with the
others?). I have given half month’s pay to all
ranks below sergeant-major. I only owe them now
half month’s pay.</p>

<p>If the General of the expeditionary force has
sent up a force, <i>by Nile to Berber, to take Berber</i>,
and <i>then</i> if he marches across with <i>bulk of force</i>
from Merowé, in my humble opinion he has done
the right thing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>If Berber had not been taken it would have been
a picnic. Baring!! Baring!!<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The force going up Nile from Merowé to Berber
would have pretty well quieted the banks of the Nile,
for the <i>triangle</i> contained by <i>Merowé</i>, <i>Abou Hamed</i>,
and <i>Berber</i>, so that the bulk of the force, moving
from Merowé to the captured Berber, would only
be exposed to attacks from the south flank, where
there are few people. My experience is that whenever
you can possibly do so, never expose yourself
to be attacked on all points of the compass; at
any rate secure yourself on <i>one flank</i>. The force
advancing up the Nile were protected on one
flank, the Nile; that going across from Merowé to
Berber, will be protected on the north flank by the
subjugated triangle. Arabs this evening appear
not to intend to come to Halfeyeh. They have
a station at Giraffe, and another at Kokoo, which
is nearly opposite Giraffe, on right bank of Blue
Nile. (End of this <i>blotting paper</i>!)<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Ferratch Pasha tried again in a roundabout way
to get the £150 a month, forage (<i>i.e.</i> Dhoora) for
four horses, and rations for ten men; he utterly
failed, and had to content himself with £100
a month: they are a mean lot. (<i>Do not let any of
those Egyptians</i> in the steamers <i>come back here</i> is my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
earnest prayer.) (Floyer will be furious at this
misuse of telegraph forms.)<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> I am truly delighted
that the <i>Abbas</i> did not leave the Greeks behind,
and only abandoned the boats carrying wood. I
hope in fourteen days to have another sister
steamer to <i>Abbas</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i> completed. I
have told them to rivet her only six inches above
water line, and to put holdfast rivets for the upper
portion which is above water, and which does not
require to be watertight.</p>

<p>They say that the <i>Fascher</i><a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> steamer had a gun
on her; she went aground near Abou Shourim
(the Father of the Truth), and got delayed in her
pursuit of the <i>Abbas</i>. The man wounded by the
mine is wounded in the head, chest, and legs; there
is not much hope of his recovery.</p>

<p>Awaan (Stewart’s friend, the secretary of Arabi)
is behaving very badly in prison; he was put in
chains by mistake and released, but it has had
no effect: he abuses the soldiers. I expect he
wrote to the Mahdi and told him of Stewart’s
departure and of the “Journal.” His arrest is said
to have been of great effect in the town; he is said
to have preached for a long time in favour of the
Mahdi.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 29.</i>&mdash;To-day, year 1301 <span class="smcap">a.h.</span>, is said to be
about the date of Hicks’s disaster; it was on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
1st, 2nd, 3rd November, but with the Arabs it was
the 12th, 13th, 14th Moharrem. The news was
known in Cairo three weeks after the event
occurred; <i>since that date up to this date</i> nine people
have come up as reinforcements&mdash;myself, Stewart,
Herbin, Hussein, Tongi, Ruckdi, and three servants,
and not one penny of money.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> Of those who came
up, two, Stewart and Herbin, have gone down:
Hussein is dead, so six of the reinforcements alone
remain, while we must have sent down over 1500
and 700 soldiers, total 2200, including the two
Pashas, Ibrahim Hardar, and Hussein Cheri, Coetlogon,
&amp;c. The regulars, who were in arrears of pay
for three months when I came, are now only owed
half a month, while the Bashi-Bazouks are owed
only a quarter month, and we have some £500
in the treasury. It is quite a miracle. We have
lost two battles, suffering severe losses in those
actions of men and arms, and may have said to
have scrambled through, for I cannot say we can
lay claim to any great success during the whole
time. Things apparently went against us when we
thought we were getting the best of it.</p>

<p>I believe we have more ammunition, Remington
(though we have fired three million rounds at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Arabs), and more soldiers now, than when I came
up. We have every reason to thank God for His
protection. We had many untoward and unexpected
misfortunes; the death of Berzati Bey<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> at
Gitana; the almost unprofitable first trip of steamers
to Sennaar, and their useless delay; our defeat
(after El foun victory), by which we lost the active
part of our troops, and our fighting Pasha, Mahomet
Ali; the surrender of Saleh Pasha and 1500 men,
with the capture of the <i>Mahomet Ali</i> steamer; the
fall of Berber, with two steamers lost. It is really
very wonderful that, with such few successes and so
many heavy disasters, we should be in the position
we are now. Of the reinforcement, Stewart and
Tongi got wounded. We have lost three steamers,
two at Berber and one at the Blue Nile, and we
have built another, the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, and hope to
have another finished in a fortnight, which makes
our loss only one. The defeat near El foun brought
about the arrival here of the Mahdi, which might
have been very serious, but his arrival has been
apparently rendered innocuous. We have £40,000
in Treasury <span class="smcap">in paper</span>, and £500. When I came up,
there was £5000 in Treasury. We have £15,000
out in the town in paper money. When I came,
we had two Pashas, <i>Ibrahim Hardar</i>, <i>Hussein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Cheri</i>; we have now two, <i>Ferratch</i> and <i>Nutzer
Pasha</i>. Two women, wives of the men who escaped
yesterday (with another very small brown baby), came
into Omdurman to-day. They say the Arabs are
very angry about the desertions; also a boy came in.
It would seem, looking over the past months, that, if
taken in detail, events have been very much against
us; while, if taken generally, we have been most
successful. I always had an idea we would not be
allowed any success which we could impute to
ourselves; that events would be so ruled that we
should just <i>scramble</i> through and have nothing to
boast of. Mahomet Ali Pasha’s defeat was owing
to his and his men and the people of Khartoum’s
desire to <i>loot</i> Sheikh el Obeyed (the <i>man</i>, not the
city). It was against my grain, for I wanted to
capture Berber, which was the proper military
operation to undertake; it was only because they
were so anxious, and represented the affair as so
easy, that I consented to it. Perhaps, if <i>we</i> had
taken Berber, Her Majesty’s Government would
have said that no expedition was necessary for the
<i>relief of the garrisons</i>; but it would not have been
correct to reason thus, for, though Berber might
have been taken, we could not have garrisoned it;
and it would have been a barren victory, and not
have done much towards the solution of the Soudan
problem or withdrawal of the garrisons, while it
might, on the other hand, have stopped the expedition
for <i>their relief</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the Mahdi’s men who have made the station
at Kokoo on right bank of the Blue Nile opposite
Giraffe, not the men of Waled a Goun; I expect it
is to overawe the Sheikh el Obeyed.</p>

<p>The Baggaras on the north side captured this
morning three of the Arabs (one is brother of the
writer whose things were found on the bank, and
whom we supposed to have been murdered); they
were stealing three horses belonging to Saleh Pasha.
A slave came in from the Arabs at Omdurman;
he says the Mahdi says, the Moharrem being a
sacred month, he does not mean to fight; he did
not act on that view <i>in re</i> Hicks; but then Hicks
attacked or tried to attack him.</p>

<p>Doubts are thrown on the veracity of that boatman,
for he told some few lies about how he went
to Berber in a Government boat, which is not true.
However, his report cheered us for a time. Some
one (Talleyrand?) said, “If a lie got currency for
twenty-four hours, it did its work.” I am still of
opinion, however, if the season was not so far
advanced, and the Nile on the fall, that the route
by the Nile for a <span class="smcap">covering</span> force was a correct
one, but it ought to have been undertaken in July
with a rising Nile.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>The three men caught to-day say the “<i>expeditionary
force is still at Debbeh</i>,” and I expect this
is the truth, for the eight steamers coming up the
Nile is scarcely possible now, since the Nile is falling.
The distance direct from Kartoum to Debbeh is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a><br /><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
nearly 250 miles, and if the Kababish are friendly,
the road is not a bad one; however, I think
<i>Ambukol to Metemma</i> (could the force know I had
the five steamers at Metemma) would be better, for
it is only 150 miles, and from Debbeh to Ambukol
there is water transport. The road from Ambukol
to Metemma does not plunge so deeply into desert;
indeed, <i>Merowé to Berber</i>, 150 miles, with water
transport from Debbeh to Merowé, would be best
of all, if the force could cross the Nile at Berber.
The only enemy the force will meet with, on any of
the three roads, are camel-men and horsemen, till
it arrives on the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>October 30.</i>&mdash;This morning the Arabs came to
Halfeyeh, capturing some of our heedless people;
whether they will stay there or not I do not know&mdash;rumour
says they are on their way to Shoboloha
and Shendy to repel the ravages of steamers.</p>

<p>You have the map made by railway engineers of the
route from Ambukol to Metemma, which must have
all information, wells, &amp;c., &amp;c. I should put five
station forts along the line, and when I made my debouch
at Metemma I should split off one detachment
to capture Berber, and another towards Kartoum,
taking care of any guns in Shoboloha defile (during
which passage I should march the men, and not
leave them in the steamers or boats). I would
make my base at Metemma for all operations in
the Soudan connected with the Nile Valley&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
numbers I have put for the forts along road are
probably in excess of what would be required.</p>

<p>The Arab force which went towards the north
(? Shendy) consists of 200 footmen, and 50 horse.</p>

<p>Two men came in from the south front&mdash;they
say the Sheikh el Obeyed is with the Mahdi; and
Waled a Goun, and Abou Gugliz are at Giraffe.
I expect that the Arabs have captured one of our
merchant’s boats at Halfeyeh.</p>

<p>We have 1300 men in the North Fort, yet 250
Arabs went boldly across our front to Halfeyeh, and
we do not dare to show our noses; this speaks for
our <i>morale</i>.</p>

<p>A slave came in at Omdurman; he says the Mahdi
says he will not fight until after Moharrem (to-day
is 12th Moharrem).</p>

<p>Arabs fired on the lines from near the White Nile
to-day, but did no harm. Not being able to sleep
last night, I was late in getting up, and consequently
every one also slept and no proper look-out was
kept on the Arabs. I should think I had written
twenty orders about their keeping a look-out, but it
is of no use. The Arabs have gone back to Giraffe.
I am going to make the officer of North Fort pay
compensation for the men wounded, and to the
families of those killed, in this raid. The map made
by the railway engineers (1874-1875) must have
every information as to water supply on Ambukol-Metemma
road.</p>

<p>In reality, the relief of the garrisons is only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
question of crossing over a <i>well-surveyed road</i> of
<i>150 miles</i>, at the end of which are found <i>five steamers</i>
and <i>nine guns</i>: of course there is a great deal of
trouble in transport arrangements, but no particular
danger.</p>

<p><i>I believe we</i> (<i>i.e.</i> those Shaggyeh) lost to-day
twenty-three soldiers taken prisoners, one killed,
one wounded; seventeen cows, five women, eight
slaves, three donkeys, seven horses,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> twenty-four
Remington rifles<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> captured; and this after I had
repeatedly warned them of an impending attack,
and specially warned them last night after the
capture of the three spies. They, these Shaggyeh,
number 1200; on the other side, with 30 horses,
the Arabs were not 200; they made no attempt to
defend themselves; dreadful lot, how I look forward
to their disbandment! Had I left them at Halfeyeh
what a time I should have had with them. The
Arabs have paid us off with interest for our cavalry
raids of a few days ago. If any troops come up,
as soon as the environs are clear around Kartoum,
I would recommend their immediate disbandment.
I cannot see any reason why the “<i>expedition for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
relief of the garrisons</i>” should not have <i>captured
Berber</i>, and <i>arrived at Kartoum on 10th November</i>
(Lord Mayor’s Show), which is giving ample time;
saying that troops did advance from Cairo on
the 15th August, which I guess (from Kitchener’s
laconic dispatch of 31st August) was the case.
That strong rumours could not have been known
at Debbeh (for at least twenty days) that Kartoum
steamers were at Metemma (plundering right
and left) is most unlikely, even if my many spies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
(sent with notes to this effect) did not get through
one of their number. These rumours should have
pointed out that the Ambukol-Metemma road was
<span class="smcap">the road</span> to follow<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>&mdash;even if not decided on before,
which is most probable.</p>

<p><i>No wells of import on flanks.</i></p>

<p>I expect water can be found along Wadi Abou Gir, as water is

no danger for a force of 200 men as far as Gebil Gelif well&mdash;that

<p class="p2"><i>October 31.</i>&mdash;Three men, soldiers, came in from
the Arabs on the White Nile last night. To-day
it is 7-23/30 months, or 233 days, since the Arabs
appeared in our immediate neighbourhood, since
which date we have had no peace.</p>

<p>It will be bitter cold in the desert, and I think,
of all the deserts, that of Dongola is the coldest.
I do not think I should send Nutzi Pasha and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Egyptians you take out of the steamers down
further than Dongola, for the moment, for if you do
you will put Dongola on the <i>qui vive</i> as to the
evacuation. Certainly, for those who are for a
rapid retreat, having a <i>tête du pont</i> (so to say) at
Metemma, much facilitates the movement; for the
garrisons and the people of Kartoum and Sennaar.
Shendy-Metemma is evidently the chief strategical
point of the Soudan; for from it you reach Kartoum,
Sennaar, and Berber by water, and Kassala
by the Atbara valley; but, short of making Fowler’s
railway to Shendy, I should prefer the making of
stations along the Nile, for a peace route and for
small forces, as by the Nile you get free of camel
transport, which depends on the temper of the Arab
tribes; besides, the Nile route is cheaper, and could
be put into execution with one high Nile.</p>

<p>The three soldiers who came in last night have
one sergeant-major among them. He says Mahmound
Khalifa wrote to his father, who is with Mahomet
Achmet, in which he says that the English General
wants him to get camels in great haste; that he is
delaying as much as possible; that the English
General wants to go in one body; that he is trying
to get him to go in four bodies; <i>that Mahmound
Khalifa</i> is a traitor, like all his family; and he
should catch it, for I expect this information is
correct. The sergeant-major says that Mahmound
Khalifa is at Dongola or Debbeh. The Mahdi is
going into a cave for this month and next; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is now in his cave. All the Europeans are with the
Mahdi (not in the cave). Slatin is very good
friends with the Mahdi, and <i>sees him</i> every day (?).
(This is rather against the cave report.)</p>

<p>The mysterious Frenchman is not with the Mahdi,
but in Kordofan. The letter which I spoke of as
coming from Mahmound Khalifa arrived at the
Mahdi’s camp fifteen days ago, so left Dongola
about twenty-two days ago (9th October). Can it
be remembered whether at that time, viz. 9th
October, any altercation took place on subject of
march?<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> In the letter is a remark, that the English
General said he wished “all to go together, for he
would not leave a sick man behind.” The man
says, Mahmound Khalifa wrote another letter to
his father, stating the start from Dongola towards
Berber. I can produce the sergeant-major who
gave this information.</p>

<p>Church parade much as usual. I expect they
exhibited the captives of yesterday. It is extraordinary
if we are employing Mahmound Khalifa,
when his father, Hussein Pasha Khalifa, is a <i>so-called</i>
prisoner of the Mahdi.  Stewart knows, I think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
that the father gave up Berber by more or less
treachery.</p>

<p>I hope the Mudir of Dongola will look after this
man. The sergeant-major says “that the Mahdi
declares” he will execute the Sheikh el Islam
(whom I put in prison) for preventing our surrendering,
by which bit of news <i>I read</i> that an adherent of
the Sheikh el Islam got some friends of his to bribe
the sergeant-major <i>to say this</i> while on his way to
the Palace.</p>

<p>Three men more have come in&mdash;one sergeant,
one corporal, and a slave&mdash;from the Arabs at Omdurman.
They say many Arabs leave daily for
Kordofan; the Mahdi has sent three companies of
regulars to bring back deserters; the Mahdi has
been taking women from others, which makes the
Arabs doubt his holiness; he has only forty
rounds for each Krupp gun, of which he has two.
The slave was a great fat bull-faced fellow. He
was honest, for when I asked him why he came
here, he said, “because he got so little to eat with
the Arabs.” His appearance belied his words.
These men said nothing of the cave business. The
living skeleton in hospital (Stewart knows him)
departed this life yesterday&mdash;I will not say, deeply
regretted, except by <i>me in a small way</i>, for I knew
him so long. It turns out that the Shaggyeh chief
who commanded in the North Fort slept in town
the day before yesterday night, and so was absent
at yesterday morning’s catastrophe; also the officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Osman Bey, who went down to Berber with
steamers to escort the <i>Abbas</i> past Berber, and who
let the <i>Fascher</i> pursue the <i>Abbas</i> never reported
this man’s absence; I have turned them out, and cut
them each a month’s pay. (No sentry as usual, on
North Fort. They are incorrigible. 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Though
their men have gone to look for missing rifles,
I ordered them thirty blows: <i>i.e.</i> the sentries.)</p>

<p>Two cows have kindly walked into Omdurman
Fort. The Arabs fired a few shots on the lines
near the White Nile, which did not reach them;
I expect the Arab chiefs send out the regulars and
tell them to fire on the lines, and the regulars obey
orders much as my orders are obeyed here. The
North Fort hate my telescope; day and night I
work them. It is one of Chevalier’s, of Paris,
which I picked up here and gave £5 for, it is by
far the best glass I ever saw. Commander J. Baker,
R.N., has the <i>best</i> opera-glasses; he got them from
me at Berberah in 1878, in exchange; they belonged
to the Egyptian Government. It was the father of
Hussein Pasha Khalifa who led the Egyptians into
the Soudan in 1823. The family comes from
Assouan, for this, the grant of monopoly of commerce
through Korosko desert was given to the
family. It was taken away from them in Ismail
Pasha Ayoub’s time, about 1872, and I restored it to
them. I heard the Mahdi gave them this monopoly
after the fall of Berber, or rather agreed to their
retaining it. I think the only good one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
family was Sheikh Hamid, who died this year. I
sent the horsemen of these Shaggyeh out to the
scene of yesterday’s disaster; they recovered a horse!
two donkeys! and three Remingtons! and found
the body of one of their slaves. I am going to
make them pay for the lost Remingtons, nineteen in
number now. I cannot afford to have Remingtons
thrown away like that. This recalls to my mind
how, when I had 700 men in the North Fort, which
consisted of two houses distant sixty yards apart,
the great Melon, who was in the house where the
telegraph office is, declined to open the door of his
house and sent a message to the other house, for
fear of the Arabs, who were camped three miles
distant.  It was like this:</p>

<p>I have ever felt the greatest insecurity respecting
the lines, for I believe one hundred determined men
would carry them with ease, if they made their
attack on the Shaggyeh or Bashi Bazouk part.
These creatures used to shut themselves into the
houses at about 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and never go out till it was
broad daylight; they were not eighty yards from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the river. The Cairo Turkish Bashi Bazouks, the
Shaggyeh, and the Fellaheen soldiers, I will back
against any troops in the world for <i>cowardice</i>! I
expect the reason why the Arabs did not take the
three recaptured horses was because they were as
frightened nearly as our men (<i>vide</i> p. 259); the
worst of it is, that it is taken generally as a thing
of “<i>matter of course</i>” by the Kartoum people, and,
one may say, officers; no one is a bit put out or
ashamed; it teaches no experience. <i>Vide</i> the
absence of sentries on the fort to-day, who, I
expect, cannot sit down over-comfortably to-night
after their thirty blows.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>One cannot help feeling amused at these Shaggyehs,
for they are the most arrant braggadocios,
as are the Cairo Turkish Bashi Bazouks, and when
you come up, if you do, you will see how they will
exhibit. They have little kettledrums about a span
in diameter; whenever I hear them I feel viciously
inclined. This dates back many years. The
Shaggyeh are very quiet to-day; they are all boxed
up in the houses; very few have ventured out more
than 2000 yards. The report is that they are
ashamed, which, if words could make them so, they
ought to be; but I doubt it. They have not beaten
their kettledrums to-night; yes, they have begun to
beat them now. On one occasion, when I had two
guns in their fort, I had a truly miserable night; for
a cow would have taken the fort, though there were
1200 men in it. It was more for the guns than for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
them that I was anxious. The horse, which was
recovered to-day, was saddled and <i>was</i> bridled, but,
like a wise brute, as he could not eat with the bit in
his mouth, he put his foot on the bridle and broke it
off. I telegraphed to the rider “that I felt sure he
could not look him in the face after leaving him out
all night for nothing with the saddle on.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 1.</i>&mdash;The Arabs came up to their old
fort in front of Bourré this morning and fired a few
shots; they did not stay five minutes there. A
Boulak Basha, his son, and two slaves came in to
Omdurman and report the Mahdi is in the cave; that
Slatin has retained all his property; that the Arabs
continue to desert the Mahdi, who sends the regulars
after them; that the deserting Arabs fight the
soldiers, and have killed many of them; that the
Arabs generally doubt the mission of the Mahdi,
and wish for the return of the Government. The
Mahdi is not going to fight during Moharrem and
Saphia months. Two hundred and fifty Arabs
deserted yesterday. The Mahdi sent the regulars
after them, and four regulars were killed, and the
deserters got away. Fifty to one hundred per diem
run away. These people are a fine lot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
merchants of the market have been refusing to give
more than three and a-half reals for a sovereign, five
to six reals being the proper rate; so I captured
nine of the chief of them, and have sent them to
the lines with a pretended order to send them out
to Waled a Goun, but with orders to keep them on
the lines. I hope this will cure them. I shall let
them in again when they sign a paper agreeing to
my terms. Of course it is tyranny, but there is no
other course to be pursued. The nine culprits,
three soldiers with fixed bayonets before, three
soldiers with ditto behind, and a mounted cavass
on each flank, are wending their way to the lines
through the market. Quite a procession! My
servants are my staff. I never hear these sort of
things from the officials, who are bribed, I expect,
to keep silence.</p>

<p>7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> A small bright fire in direction of
and below Halfeyeh, lasting scarcely a minute. I
flatter myself I keep a good look out.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>Two soldiers came to Omdurman, escaping from
the Arabs this evening. Nothing new.</p>

<p>One of the trying things of this existence is the
way that one is waylaid as one goes out with petitions
for dhoora, and howled at. These are the
times when one feels <i>amiably</i> disposed towards the
gentlemen who have ruled in Cairo for the last
seven years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 2.</i>&mdash;Those men I sent out ostensibly
to the Arabs have given in, and I have let them
back into town. I hate these coercive measures.
But what is to be done? This frightening them is
better than putting them in prison, or chaining
them. No words are of any avail, or orders. Two
dervishes with their weapons presented themselves
before lines this morning, saying they had a letter
from the Mahdi for me (at Mesalamieh Gate). I
said, “Leave the letter and go back; I will not let
you in. It is no use any more writing.”</p>

<p>The Arabs fired on the lines near the White Nile.
We answered, and committed some damage, from all
appearance; for the whole Dem turned out. I have
forbidden all firing on the Arabs, unless they come
so near as to injure our people; for I expect this
vague firing is only performed by the captured
soldiers to conform, in appearance, to the orders of
the Arab chiefs.</p>

<p>Letter has come in;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> it is an address to the whole
town; it has no seal, the usual rubbish about the
Mahdi being Mahdi, &amp;c. A soldier came in from
the Arabs at Omdurman; he says the Mahdi is not
in the cave, but in a tent (very stupid man!) Some
one has stolen 93,000 okes of biscuit; this robbery
took place nearly a year ago, and was only found
out two days ago. The people of the town wonder
at one’s getting no information; the last I had was
from Kitchener, dated 31st August, and received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
17th September, now forty-six days ago. Had our
people sent to Kassala <i>viâ</i> Massowah,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> there is
no doubt information could have got through, but
it is no use saying any more on the subject. I
suppose you acted according to “your conscience,
best of your ability, and custom of war in like
cases.”</p>

<p>3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Sentries off the roof of the North Fort
again; sent over to have them flogged!</p>

<p>Rectified list of biscuit is 266,430 okes.</p>

<p>Dhoora is 2110 ardebs in magazine to-day&mdash;six
weeks’ consumption!! and then the sponge must be
thrown up.</p>

<p>I could write volumes of pent-up wrath on
this subject if I did not believe things are ordained
and all work for the best. I am not at
all inclined to order half rations with a view to
any prolongation of our blockade; if I did so, it
would probably end in a catastrophe<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> before the
time, in which, if full rations are given, we should
have exhausted our supplies. I should be an
angel (which I am not, needless to say) if I was
not rabid with Her Majesty’s Government; but
I hope I may be quiet on the subject of this
Soudan and Cairo business, with its indecision; but
to lose all my beautiful black soldiers is enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to make one angry with those who have the
direction of our future.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Arabs fired four rounds this evening towards the
lines near White Nile, but did no harm (one shell
fell in the town) with their Krupp.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 3.</i>&mdash;Two women and one boy came
in to Omdurman from the Arabs; also seven cows
walked into the same place. To-day is <i>our</i> anniversary
of Hicks’s defeat. I have let out several
of the men whom I had arrested as adherents of the
Mahdi; they have had a good warning.</p>

<p>4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> <i>Bordeen</i> in sight: I have let out the Sheikh
el Islam, Cadi, and the old Mudir. A soldier came
from the Arabs to Omdurman; he says Slatin is a
prisoner for the last three days. With this man
came in a spy from the Mahdi, whom I put in prison.
The Mahdi has sent regulars to the rear. I shall
send down the <i>Bordeen</i> the day after to-morrow to
Metemma, and shall send the <i>débris</i>, Tongi &amp; Co.
down with the steamer, and you can send them
on to Cairo. I think this is noble on my part,
for you get their boats and they use your camels.
The post has come in from <i>Bordeen</i>. Kitchener’s
letter, saying “<i>Abbas</i> was captured” was a terrible
blow (I send back the letters sent to Stewart in
envelope).<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Kitchener asks who were on board: Stewart,
Power, and Herbin, the French Consul, and the
Greeks named in the margin on the other side.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
I cannot understand it, for the general opinion was
that the route was quite safe for the <i>Abbas</i>, which
had a mountain gun and some fifty soldiers in her.
I can only put it down to some treachery on the
part of the Arabs pretending to be friends.</p>

<p>I cannot decipher Lord Wolseley’s telegram,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> for
Stewart took the cipher-books. (Please inform
Foreign Office of <i>this</i>, for if he [Stewart] is killed,
and <i>Abbas</i> captured, they, the cipher-books, are in
the hands of the Mahdi.) I think cipher-messages
are in some countries, like this, a mistake.</p>

<p>The Shendy steamers sent back ten wounded
from Shendy, one seriously; and I hear they had
five killed. For goodness’ sake do not send back
any Egyptians, <i>now</i> in steamers, to Kartoum; I
include Pashas, officers, men, and exclude the
sailors, engineers, and captains of steamers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>If <i>Abbas</i> is lost, I hope a Court of Inquiry
will be held on the departure of Col. Stewart and
Messrs. Power and Herbin; for when they left we
had no news of an Expedition of Relief&mdash;<i>vide</i> my
journal; also it was generally believed that the
passage of the <i>Abbas</i> down was an absolute certainty
without danger. I also add that Stewart,
Herbin, and Power left of their own free will, and
without any order from me, as the papers captured
would show, if ever available. I refused to <i>order</i>,
but I said, “If you like to go, I will assist you to
go. It is at your own risk. The service you will
perform is great, and you can do no good here.” <i>I
wrote this to Col. Stewart</i>, in an official letter.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 4.</i>&mdash;I received private letters from
Stanley, dated Congo, 5th May, and from Sir S.
Baker, 1st June. I like the official note written on
the envelope of Sir Samuel Baker’s letter to me&mdash;“Communications
avec la Soudan interrompées.” I
should think the communications were interrompées!!!</p>

<p>The Arabs have one gun at Shendy and one gun
at Metemma; they struck <i>Mansowrah</i> four times.</p>

<p>I looked upon the descent of the <i>Abbas</i> as a
certainty. I looked upon the relief of Kartoum
as most uncertain; hence I sent down the cipher-books
of the Foreign Office. Perhaps the <i>Abbas</i>
got wrecked on the cataract. It is very sad.
There is a report that the Sheikh el Obeyed is
dead; if true, it will simplify that vexed question with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Foreign Office of the <i>man</i> and the <i>city</i>. Arabs fired
five shells at the Lines to-day; we answered with
two, and they retired. If the capture of steamer is
corroborated, tell French Consul-General that the
Mahdi has his cipher, which was with Herbin. <i>If
Abbas was captured by treachery, then I am not to
blame; neither am I to blame if she struck a rock</i>, for
she drew under two feet of water; and fifty boats
(sailing) used to go down yearly to Cairo, with high
Nile; <i>if they were attacked and overpowered, then
I am to blame</i>, for I ought to have foreseen the
chance, and prevented their going. But when they
left we knew nothing of the Expedition, and I
passed them under escort through Berber, which
was the apparent only danger they had to meet.
The Mahdi, if it is true that he has captured the
<i>Abbas</i>, found two of his own seals,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> which we had
forged but did not use, also all his letters to me,
and the journal was in most careful detail, hour by
hour, so to say. Steamer leaves at daybreak,
5th November, 1884.</p>

<p class="pc mid">EVENTS AT KARTOUM.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>November 5.</i>&mdash;Steamer <i>Bordeen</i> left this evening
for Metemma. According to all accounts the presence
of the steamers at Shendy and Metemma
cause the Arabs great annoyance, for the Arab chief
of Berber keeps calling for them to come down and
help him; while they say, “If we do, then the
steamers will pillage our houses.” I cannot get
out of my head the <i>Abbas</i> catastrophe; that the
<i>Abbas</i> (with her 970 bullet marks on her, her
gun, and her parapets, which were bullet-proof),
could be captured by force, seems impossible; that
she ran upon a rock seems unlikely, for she had her
sides defended by buffers, sunk one foot in water. I
also had warned them against ever anchoring by
the bank, also to take wood from isolated spots; in
fact, as far as human foresight goes, I did all my
possible. Why did you let them go? The matter
was thus. I determined to send the <i>Abbas</i> down
with an Arab captain. Herbin asked to be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
to go. I jumped at his offer. Then Stewart said
he would go, if I would exonerate him from deserting
me. I said you do not desert me. <i>I</i>: I cannot go;
but if you go, you do great service. I then wrote
him an official; he wanted me to write him an order.
I said “No, for though I fear not responsibility, I
will not put you in any danger in which I am not
myself.” I wrote them a letter, couched thus:
“<i>Abbas</i> is going down; you say you are willing to
go in her, if I think you can do so in honour&mdash;you
can go in honour, for you can do nothing here, and
if you go you do me service in telegraphing my
views.” You will notice the number of Greeks.
They were a bodyguard I ordered and paid highly,
to prevent any treachery on the part of the crew.
Thus the question of treachery was duly weighed
by me and guarded against, as far as I could&mdash;both
on the part of the crew and on the part of the
inhabitants&mdash;and I told them to anchor mid stream,
and not to take wood except in isolated spots.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>I escorted them by two steamers past every place
where danger could be apprehended, viz., Berber
and Shendy. They appear to have been captured
in a comparatively thinly populated place, below
Abou Hamed. I feel somehow convinced they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
captured by treachery&mdash;the Arabs pretending to be
friendly&mdash;and surprising them at night. I will own
that, without reason (apparently, for the chorus was,
that the <i>trip was safe</i>) I have never been comfortable
since they left. Stewart was a man who did
not chew the cud, he never thought of danger in
prospective; he was not a bit suspicious (while I am
made up of it). I can see in imagination the whole
scene,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> the sheikh inviting them to land, saying,
“Thank God the Mahdi is a liar”&mdash;bringing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wood&mdash;men going on shore and dispersed. The
<i>Abbas</i> with her steam down, then a rush of wild
Arabs, and all is over! A spy said something of a
chief having pretended to be friendly, and when the
<i>Abbas</i> was near, rushing on her, but then he said
the <i>Abbas</i> turned on them, and killed seventy-two
or seventy-three (see back page of this Journal).<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
It is very sad, but being ordained, we must not
murmur. I look on it as being a Nemesis on the
death of the two Pashas.</p>

<p>I do sincerely hope you will have a strict examination
into the question of Stewart, Power, and
Herbin going down. What makes me think so
much of the capture being by treachery is, that
the two sailing-boats which went with the <i>Abbas</i>
have not arrived at Debbeh, for if the <i>Abbas</i> struck
on a rock, why could not the boats come on? I
expect they were all caught at one <i>coup</i>. 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
last night Arabs fired twelve shells into the town
from their Krupps on the South Front, they did not
frighten us and did no harm. At midnight they
fired two or three volleys of musketry with no
effect. Four soldiers came in from the Arabs at
Omdurman. They state the Mahdi sent a party of
Arabs to Sennaar, the garrison sallied out and
killed nearly all of them. Also that the Baggara
Arabs, under pretence of getting better pasturage
for their cattle, asked the Mahdi to let them go
from his camp some distance, he agreed, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the people no longer regard the Mahdi as before.
Hussein Pasha Khalifa is good friends with the
Mahdi. The Arabs came near Bourré and fired
a few shots, and then went back. I expect that
the Arabs sent the regulars out, and go through
this as a mere form, one of these men<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> was with
Slatin Bey when he surrendered, and says he did
so when he had plenty of food and ammunition, and
that he (Slatin) is on the best terms with the Mahdi.
We shall not know the truth until the other
Europeans get out of the Mahdi’s clutches.</p>

<p>Stewart had about £60 in gold with him, and
<i>every paper</i> connected with our mission. I purposely
kept none here, for one did not know what one
day would bring forth; when he left on the 10th
of September we had lost over 800 men killed, and
978 Remingtons, with a lot of ammunition on 4th of
September, only six days before he left. Baker
tells me news, he says Clifford Lloyd has left on
account of row with Nubar, and that China and
France have come to terms.</p>

<p>One shell from the Arabs went over the town
and fell in the river.</p>

<p>I have mentioned that Stewart’s journal contained
all events from 1st March, 1884, to 10th September,
and if lost there is only the journal of the Doctor,
which begins 7th March, 1884.</p>

<p>I wish the correspondent of the <i>Times</i> to know
this, and to be told that the Doctor has promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
me that the <i>Times</i> shall have the first offer
of that journal. Stewart was wounded near the
Palace, at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on Sunday, 25th May, in the
arm (flesh wound). If Sennaar has beaten back the
Arabs a second time I cannot see how it is possible
to abandon the garrison, and if they are to be relieved,
I see at least a delay of four months; all
this could be avoided by handing the Soudan over
to the Sultan with a subsidy. When Stewart left
we were at the lowest ebb, the Arabs from Kordofan
had arrived with their guns, and our three
steamers were just in from Sennaar, with seven
shot holes in them.</p>

<p>Hansall, the Austrian Consul, has a daily journal;
Power and Herbin had one also.</p>

<p>I have captured<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> all the European telegrams which
we sent and which we received. I shall hand them
over to you, as they are in cipher, and as you may
have the F. O. cipher books, you can peruse them.
Stewart (as I have said) carried off the cipher books
with him; he had two copies of the journal, but I
did not like to ask him to leave one here, as I said,
have bolted&mdash;they are his best horsemen&mdash;also that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
“you can send one home, while you keep the copy
to refer to.”</p>

<p>I send with this the Firman of Towfik and the
letters<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> respecting the troops withdrawing, which I
received at Cairo on the 23rd January, 1884, and
which have not been promulgated.</p>

<p>If Stewart, Power, and Herbin died because they
would not change their religion, they are as much
martyrs as Peter or Paul.</p>

<p>A black boy of ten years was caught by the
Arabs outside of the Lines this morning, collecting
grass, and he escaped from them this evening and
came back to the town; he is a smart boy.</p>

<p>If the <i>Abbas</i> is taken, the Mahdi has the small
seal I used in my former time, and he captured at
fall of Berber my large seal, so he has both. If it is
true, the <i>Abbas</i> must have been captured between
Abou Hamed and Merowé, on or about the 18th
September. Now, on the 18th September the Arabs
must have known of Kitchener being at Debbeh,
since he wrote to me from that place on 31st August.
Probably Stewart was lulled into security in feeling
himself so near Merowé, and on account of the
news the Sheikh gave him of the advance of the
expedition.</p>

<p>Abou Hamed is one hundred miles from Merowé,
which, with the current, the <i>Abbas</i> could do in
twelve hours, and there is only one small cataract to
pass, which is, by all accounts, an easy one. Stewart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
had a supreme contempt for the Soudanese people,
and for their courage, which I do not share. That
our men are not heroes, I agree, but we had against
us the feeling that the Arabs were ten times our
numbers, while we had received no reinforcements
whatever.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> If he (Stewart) has fallen, it is because
he was carried away by the idea the Arabs would
not dare to do anything. Power had the same defect,
viz., over-rashness in not considering the material they
had to support them. You may be very strong yourself,
but your strength is of no avail if you are supported
by weaker vessels. The rate of progress of
a fleet is decided by the speed of the slowest vessel,
so up here one ought to work as if the whole mass
was as cowardly as the greatest coward in the force.
If the <i>Abbas</i> went on a rock she had two boats
(which I expressly mentioned to Stewart were to be
taken in case of such an accident), and they could
have got into them, and, with the current, got down
easily. I sent, in 1878, a boat with a large tank, in
which were four hippopotami (infants); it got down
to <i>Cairo</i> in fifty days from <i>here</i>, and Stewart had the
Reis, or pilot of that boat, in the <i>Abbas</i>. Humanly
speaking, when Stewart left here the condition of
Kartoum was desperate; while, on the other hand,
when once the <i>Abbas</i> passed Berber, which we
escorted her past, the certainty was she would reach
Dongola, and even we discussed whether Dongola<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
might not have fallen, and agreed that the <i>Abbas</i>
even in that case could have got down to Wadi
Halfa, in which case I told Stewart to go on with
her to Cairo. Men may not remember the case of
Captain ..., who took a middy up against Taepings
with him, which middy was killed. Middy’s
father ... made a great row about this.  Why
did ... take the middy up, &amp;c. I say, in defence
of my letting Stewart go, that both he, Power, and
Herbin felt our situation here was desperate after
the defeat at El foun&mdash;that I had, over and over
again, said it was impossible for me to go, physically
impossible, because even my servants would have
betrayed me (even if I had felt inclined to leave),
and I would die here (even going so far as to have
two mines brought to the palace with which to blow
it up if the place fell). These three men’s ideas
were that it was shabby to leave me, but when I
showed them they could do no possible good by
being prisoners, and when I said I shall send the
<i>Abbas</i> with the journal, then, first, Herbin, then
Stewart, and then Power, said they would go in her.
A long conversation took place between me and
Stewart, he wishing me to <i>order</i>, I declining to do
so, on account of eventualities which might arise:
it ended in my writing the letter I alluded to in
former pages of the journal. I avow I was glad
they went, 1. because I thought it was quite safe;
2. because I knew if Europe knew of the state of
affairs the Government would be shamed into action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember that this was when the last telegram<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
from Egerton was to the effect that “Her Majesty’s
Government would pay <i>on delivery</i> for all who came
down, if I contracted with Arabs.” Stewart’s idea
was that every order of Her Majesty’s Government,
or wish that they expressed, was indisputable. We
often discussed the nuisance we must have been to
Her Majesty’s Government in being sent up here,
and I think he was, to some degree, actuated by a
desire to aid Her Majesty’s Government when he
went down, for then it only left one nuisance
(myself), and I had so completely exonerated Her
Majesty’s Government by my letters, and the notes
in his journal, that they might, as far as I was
concerned, have let the garrison fall. On my part,
I do not think I could have done Her Majesty’s
Government a better service than to have, at any
rate, tried to send Stewart down with Power and
Herbin, for certainly it only left a small remnant
here of Europeans (<i>one of whom is mad</i>), and the
French government could no longer say a word.
Next, Stewart knew everything, and could tell
Her Majesty’s Government the pros and cons, from
their point of view, and with feelings akin to theirs,
which they would accept from Stewart, and never
without suspicion from me (in which they are justified,
for I do not look on things from their point of
view). I told Stewart also, “I know you will act
conscientiously and honourably; but I know your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
opinions, and, therefore, as you have all my views
on the Soudan in your journal, I beg you will, in
answering queries of Her Majesty’s Government,
make extracts from the journal, and state ‘General
G. says this, or that,’ while you are at full liberty to
give your opinion, even if it differs from mine, but
let Her Majesty’s Government know <i>when I answer</i>
and <i>when you answer</i>.” Stewart, the night he left,
wrote at my dictation a series of questions, which
I answered on half-margin of the same paper, and in
which I said, “If Her Majesty’s Government have
not acted up to time when you get down, then it is
too late, and it is no use doing anything.”</p>

<p>A curious thing has happened; my friend Kitchener
sent up the post; he wrapped the letters in
some old newspapers (he gave me no news in his
letter), the old newspapers were thrown out in the
garden: there a clerk who knew some English
found them blowing about, and gave them to the
apothecary of the hospital, who knows English.
The doctor found him reading them, saw date
<i>15th September</i>, and secured them for me; they
are like gold, as you may imagine, since we have
had no news since 24th February, 1884!</p>

<p>These papers gave us far more information than
any of your letters. Did K. send them by accident
or on purpose? Abyssinian ambassadors in
London, Walmer Castle, &amp;c.; my black troops
beating back Ras Aloula at Keren, not recognizing
the Hewitt Treaty, and killing 194 of the Abyssinians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
at Keren, <i>vide Standard</i>, 1 and 15 September.
Lord Wolseley seen off at Victoria Station,
for the <i>Gordon relief expedition!! NO! for the
relief of Soudan garrisons</i>. Khedive expressing
delight at seeing Lord N., while during the audience
the Khedive displayed great cordiality towards
Lord N. Abdel Kader saying you would have four
hard fights. I do not believe it.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>It appears that these newspapers were chucked
out of the Palace; but that a man saw the papers
were thrown out, and said to the cavass, “Give me
those papers to wrap up tobacco.” The cavass
gave them, and the doctor’s assistant going to the
shop saw them, and seeing the date, took them,
and then the doctor got them.</p>

<p>I think that the defeat of Ras Aloula, at Keren,
if true, is splendid; when the Abyssinian Ambassadors
were being entertained at Walmer Castle.
The Hewitt Treaty, instead of aiding us, appears
only to have added to our enemies.</p>

<p>It does seem wonderful if Her Majesty’s Government
have made a treaty with King John to
give over Bogos, <i>i.e.</i> Keren, <i>i.e.</i> Senheit, to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
(with other places), that orders were not sent to the
fortress to evacuate; but if the papers we secured
are true, that Ras Aloula was beaten back, it is
evident no such orders were given. What an extraordinary
state of affairs! Mitzakis, in his letter
to Greek Consul here of date 25th of August, says,
<i>that possession will be taken of Keren</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Senheit,
<i>i.e.</i> Bogos) <i>at once</i>, and then we have the telegram
from Massowa that Ras Aloula has <i>attacked</i>
Keren, and lost heavily (<i>vide</i> the <i>Standard</i> of 1st
September). By these papers, miraculously secured,
I see we have made Minister of Interior Abdel
Kader Pasha; according to all accounts up here,
he is “Abdel Kader and the Forty Thieves <i>in
one</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 6.</i>&mdash;Three horsemen and four footmen
(Arabs) came opposite Bourré to-day on right bank
of the Nile, and fired a few shots, and went off on
our firing two shots from Krupp. Also, the Arabs
came down with their guns to the White Nile end
of Lines, and fired on the Santals. A soldier of
ours came in from Sheikh el Obeyed with his wife
and child; he says <i>Sheikh el Obeyed died</i> four days
ago (to the great relief of Sanderson), now we have
only the <i>city</i> to deal with. Two more soldiers came
in from Arabs at Omdurman. The Arabs fired seven
rounds from their guns on the Lines near the White
Nile. A post was captured by Sheikh el Obeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
(with European letters, coming from Kassala) just
before his death; the porter of these letters was
killed.</p>

<p>I expect that the naming of the expedition the
Gordon Relief Expedition is because the fiction
“<i>that Her Majesty s Government has no responsibility
towards the Soudan and its garrisons</i>” is going to
be held to, and that the object of the expedition
<i>thus named</i>, will be considered as accomplished, if
Kartoum is reached; but in that case, how can the
sending up Stewart and me be explained? It was
certainly because our Government thought they
were responsible that we were sent; also if Her
Majesty’s Government has no responsibility, why
did the troops attack Osman Digma, and relieve
Tokar?<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>The Sheikh el Obeyed’s death will be a heavy
blow to the Arabs, for his following will no longer
hold together.</p>

<p>Another soldier, with his wife, has come in at
Omdurman.</p>

<p>These men report Sheikh el Obeyed dead, and
that he is succeeded by his son Achmet, and that
not more than 1000 or 1500 are with him; the
Mahdi and the Arabs are against any attack on
the Kartoum Lines. A good many Baggara are
still with Mahdi, who is daily losing followers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>A soldier was severely wounded this morning at
Bourré.</p>

<p>They say Sheikh el Obeyed died of chagrin. He
would not go and see the Mahdi, who sent him
word to give up all his property.</p>

<p>What a fury King John will be in, if it is true
Keren has fired on and killed his men; he will
swear it is Towfik’s treachery. I wonder who are
the Treaty Powers&mdash;Towfik and King John, or our
Government and King John? Keren is only three
days from Massowah, and it is not likely they
would invent this telegram. It makes one laugh,
to think of this addition to our enemies kindly
given us.</p>

<p>The soldier (who came in with his wife and two
children) says that Sheikh el Obeyed captured a
post with the Arab and European letters; that he
sat for some time in a comatose state, and then
died; that his people are all dispersing. This is
a great comfort, for we will have (D.V.) no fighting
there. A soldier and his mother have come in.
They say the Mahdi moved his camp to-day four
hours further off. This evening the Arabs fired
six times, with their guns, on the Lines near the
White Nile.</p>

<p>I knew Harrison<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> would come. Extract A<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the other side shows you, A, if you cannot protect
dhows <i>now</i>, how will you do so if all the Soudan falls
into hands of the Mahdi? Also extract B respecting
rebellion in Hedjaz, will show all their lands are in
a fermenting state, and will be well worked up by
the Mahdi if he ever gets to Kartoum. Another
man who came in says the Mahdi has drawn closer
to Omdurman, and has <i>not gone further off</i>. I have
an idea the Arabs will make a try to take the place.
A soldier was wounded on the Lines near the White
Nile this evening; he was fishing, and got hit. It
certainly does seem most miraculous that Suakin
should be besieged<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and dhows captured close to it;
no lesson has yet been taught these Arabs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 7.</i>&mdash;We captured two cows to-day at
Bourré. Mahdi’s camp is now alongside of Faki
Mustapha’s, which is one hour and a half from the
Fort Omdurman.</p>

<p>A large body of Arabs left, with caravan, the
Dem of Faki Mustafa, in a north-west direction,
towards the Gabra Wells, the Kababish headquarters.
The Dem of the Mahdi is not far from
the river, by which I conjecture he has his Krupps
in position near there.  Church parade going on,
average size.  I am anxious for the flank of the
lines ending on the White Nile,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and have sent up a
steamer to stay there. Four soldiers, one slave and
two women came from the Arabs to Omdurman.
The Mahdi means to attack Omdurman; he has
received 120 camels of ammunition; Slatin is in
chains. These men say the Mahdi and the Arabs
have not the least intention of risking their skins
against the fort, but will shove on the Black Regulars
they have captured.  It is like fighting one’s
own flesh and blood; it is not fair warfare.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>If I am inclined to be vicious I have some little
excuse, with women yelling for dhoora, under the
Palace windows! Church parade to-day, and the
approach nearer to us of the Mahdi’s camp, and his
sending for and getting 120 camel loads of ammunition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
does not show he is wanting in confidence, for
if he did fear, he would never have sent for 500,000
rounds of ammunition; or if he had sent for it, he
would have stopped its coming, had he feared the
advance. The fact is that the Tokar affair, with
the non-following up of the victory,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> has given him
great confidence, which is strengthened by his Arabs
capturing dhows and firing on the lines of Suakin
with impunity. Perhaps the non-firing on Suakin for
three days (August 30) means that the Hadendowa
Arabs have gone to assist Berber! I wonder
whether it has not been observed, that Suakin is
perfectly useless if the Soudan is in the hands of
the Mahdi. I declare I think he (the Mahdi) has
a fair chance of getting to Mecca, if the rebellion
in the Hedjaz goes on, and he gets Kartoum.</p>

<p>The Mahdi may, and I daresay has good information
from Cairo, as to the intention of the
expedition, or he may reason, “They will relieve
Kartoum, leave me alone in my camp, and go back.”
If the Government instructions are definite, and
going to be carried out at any cost, and if they are
to the effect that a <i>Rapid Retreat</i> is to take place,
then nothing more is to be said. All I ask for then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
is to be put out of my place here,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> to go on my
way, and be no more employed. That is not
an unreasonable demand, for my mission here was
a special one, and not obligatory, like a military
duty, and in my position of Governor-General I am
quite justified in having said and done everything
for the people over whom I was placed by Towfik
(following the “<i>fiction</i>” that he was independent)
that I thought would secure them safety. <i>If it
is determined to abandon</i> Sennaar and Kassala
(following the <i>fiction</i> that the King of Abyssinia
will look after them), also the Equator, <i>to their
fate</i>, after their gallant defence, there is nothing
more to be said, and the sooner this action is performed
the better, if it is to be performed at all.
To execute the operation, if it is confined to the
evacuation of Kartoum, I can be of no possible
use, and I do not care to wait and see the Mahdi
walk in on your heels into Kartoum, which we
have held against him for so many months; neither
do I wish to see Her Majesty’s forces dogged by
these Arabs all the way to Wady Halfa, or to
receive the remonstrances of those who have stuck
to me. I am sure I have now written so fully
on all these subjects that there can be little room
for further discussion: you have to make up your
mind and act. I have fully expressed my views
and desires, and shall <i>take, or try to take</i>, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
philosophically your decision; though I do most
emphatically protest against this abandonment,
which will lead to greater disasters, and is unworthy
of our country.</p>

<p>The men who came in to-day say the Mahdi will
attack Omdurman to-morrow. The following decisions
have to be taken if the rapid retreat is carried
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Are the Government stores to be destroyed?</p>

<p>2. Are you prepared to supply transport for all
who wish to go down?</p>

<p>3. Will you disarm the Shaggyeh ere you leave?</p>

<p>4. What will you do with the steamers?</p>

<p>I declare I should tremble to give these orders.
As Governor-General <i>I never would do it</i>.</p>

<p>5. Will you write to Sennaar and Kassala, and
inform them of what you mean to do, and exonerate
me?</p>

<p>(A slave came in from the Arabs. He says the
Arabs will not attack the lines; that the regulars
are all over with the Mahdi on the left bank.)</p>

<p>6. Will you negotiate with the Mahdi (no use, I
expect) <i>in re</i> the deliverance of the prisoners (European)
he has with him?</p>

<p>7. Would you object to aiding the black troops
to go to Sennaar and to fight out the question, with
the view of saving Sennaar and Kassala garrisons?</p>

<p>Two soldiers and one slave came in from Arabs
at Omdurman; they say the Mahdi will not attack
directly, that Slatin is in chains for writing to Kartoum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
also Saleh Pasha. The Arabs fired two
rounds from their guns towards the lines near the
White Nile this evening. They fell short.</p>

<p>Supposing Kartoum evacuated, then Sennaar and
Kassala fall. The Arabs now fire on the lines at
Suakin, and capture dhows in the Red Sea, and
there is a revolt in the Hedjaz. What is to prevent
the Mahdi’s adherents gaining Mecca, where there
are not 2,000 men. Once at Mecca, we may look
out for squalls in Turkey, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If decision is taken on the Rapid Retreat proceeding,
the consuls should be warned on your arrival.</p>

<p>If the British Government had only given us
Zubair Pasha in March, when I asked for him, we
would not have lost Berber, and would never have
wanted an expedition. We would have beaten the
Mahdi without any exterior help; it is sad, when
the Mahdi is moribund that we should by evacuation
of Kartoum, raise him again. The defect I laboured
under has been that I presented no rallying point
to the people, not being of their nation or creed.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>The Arabs began musketry fire on Bourré at
1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and before this morning. It was quite like
old times, when it used to go on for months. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
never got accustomed to it, for I knew what troops
we had, and it always murdered sleep.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 8.</i>&mdash;It must be obvious that if Zubair
was with you, and installed as Governor-General,
with a semi-independent position and a subsidy, in
the present decaying position of the Mahdi, and
your temporary presence, he would rally around him
a huge following, who are now disgusted with the
Mahdi and his dervishes, but who will be obliged to
hold to him, because you evacuate; even those
people with us, we per force oblige to join the Mahdi.
Zubair’s installation would save you all the bother
of the Sennaar evacuation. You would have only
to stay up here a couple of months, and perhaps
have to keep a detachment at Berber and Dongola
(in order that Zubair might get up more munitions)
for a time. You have now boats fitted for the
communication by the Nile, via Abou Hamed, and
Zubair could soon put them along the Nile in a
chain. As for the slave trade,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> the Mahdi will be
ten times worse than Zubair, and you could make
the payment of the subsidy (to Zubair) contingent
on his not doing it on any vast scale. The Zubair
solution is the sort of half-way house between
rapid retreat and continued occupation, either by
Turks or yourself.</p>

<p>The Mahdi could never get the people to rise
against Zubair; it will be only because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
presented with no rallying point, and per force they
will join him if you leave. They never would have
joined the Mahdi if Zubair had come up. It is only
because Zubair was not here that Berber fell.</p>

<p>6.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Arabs streaming across from the White
Nile to Bourré. Some Arabs on the right bank of
the Blue Nile look as if they are coming down that
bank to the North Fort. I have ordered up the
steamers <i>Ismailia</i> and <i>Husseinyeh</i>. The Arabs have
found our weak point, <i>i.e.</i> prolongation of our lines
at Bourré, but the steamers will drive them out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-371.jpg" width="400" height="121"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>7.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Fight still going on, steamer coming
up the river. 8.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Steamers went up and drove
the Arabs off the right bank of the Blue Nile, who
were enfilading our lines. The firing, which has been
continuous for four hours, has pretty well ceased.
Up to this we have had no killed or wounded, I am
glad to say. During the night the Arabs on the
left bank of the White Nile (Mahdi’s camp) fired
three shells against the lines ending on right bank
of the White Nile. A soldier <i>fellaheen</i> is thought
to have deserted to the Arabs last night. 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;The
Arabs have collected in the vicinity of Omdurman
Fort a heap of cows, who seem drawing down
towards the fort. I have ordered <i>Ismailia</i> to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
down. I expect they will drive the cows on to the
fort, and try and explode the mines. The Arabs
on the White Nile are firing on the lines with their
Krupp. 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Arabs are leaving the vicinity of
Bourré, and going back to their Dem near the
White Nile. The Arabs near Omdurman village are
firing across the river towards Mogrim.</p>

<p>The Austrian Consul when taking his morning
ride was surprised at seeing two balls strike the
water near, and so he returned. 10.45 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;The
<i>battles</i> are over, and all is quiet. What a worry all
this is! The rockets from Omdurman drove back
the advance of the cows; it was an ingenious attempt,
if meant.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>I expect the Arabs fired away 30,000 rounds to-day.
We had <i>one man killed</i> in small steamer, and
<i>one wounded</i>; in the fort we had <i>two wounded</i>, and
<i>one man</i> was wounded by bursting of rocket tube at
Omdurman. I hate these rockets with sticks. Hale’s
are the only decent ones; not that the sticks have
anything to do with their bursting. The composition
in these climates shrinks away from the case,
and the fire flares up the whole of the <i>exterior</i> and
<i>interior</i> of the rocket. I expect we are going to
have a series of these festivities, which are so wearisome.
In the <i>Abbas</i> there was a heap of money
orders, &amp;c., connected with the merchants here, so
sure did they think she would get down. Six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
soldiers came in from the Arabs, also four slaves,
who report the Arabs are thinking of putting a
post at Halfeyeh. (I hope they will not.) The
Mahdi has about 8,000 men of sorts with him.
Slatin is in chains, also Saleh Pasha. Hussein
Pasha Khalifa is great friends with the Mahdi.
Omdurman captured sixteen cows when they came
near the fort, also one slave. They killed one Arab.
The men who came in say the Arabs mean to
continue this day’s festivities every day. They do
not seem to care much about the advance of the
expedition, or are uncommonly confident or ignorant.
I do not at all enjoy the thought of these
<i>daily festivities</i>, they are “abrutissant,” as the
Austrian Consul says.</p>

<p>It is very curious what a very little effect all our
immense preparations at Dongola, &amp;c., has had on
the course of events; one may say they have not had
up to the present the least, while I have weakened
myself by sending down my steamers<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and four
hundred men (not, however, of the best quality).
I expect we will have the <i>festivity</i> to-morrow on the
White Nile end of the Lines, which is our weakest
part. I must not be blamed at looking forward to
a repetition of the past miseries; we truly have had
a wearisome time for 241 days! Another soldier
has come in; he says the Mahdi thought Kartoum
could be bombarded from his new camp, but finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
it cannot be done. If Lord Wolseley did say he
hoped to relieve Kartoum before “<i>many months</i>,”
he must have a wonderful confidence in our powers
of endurance, considering that <i>when</i> he is said to
have made this utterance, we had been blockaded
six-and-a-half months, and are now in our ninth
month. I am quite sure of one thing, that the
policy followed up till lately (and the policy which
may be carried out, of abandoning Sennaar, etc.) is
one which will act detrimentally on our army; for
what officer, if he was in a fortress, could have any
confidence that it might not be thought advisable to
abandon him. Her Majesty’s Government told me,
or rather my friend Baring told me<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> I was not to
leave Kartoum for the Equator until I had permission.
I have his telegram (so that if it was
possible, or if I could do it) if I did leave Kartoum,
I should be acting against orders. This Soudan
business will cost me £3000<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> beyond my pay, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
least, which I will not ask them or allow them to
pay. I shall get it from others, and I shall get
another £1000 to buy Stewart’s journal, if he has
been killed or captured.</p>

<p>Another soldier is in from the Arabs at Omdurman
which fort has captured four more cows, that
is twenty to-day (a cow is worth £20 in town!)
£400! There is one thing which is quite incomprehensible.
If it is right to send up an expedition
now, why was it not right to send it up before? It is
all very well to say one ought to consider the difficulties
of the Government, but it is not easy to get
over a feeling, that “a hope existed of no expedition
being necessary, owing to our having fallen.” As for
myself, personally, I feel no particular rancour on the
subject, but I own I do not care to show I like men,
whoever they may be, who act in such a calculating
way, and I do not think one is bound to act the
hypocrite’s part, and pretend to be friendly towards
them. If a boy at Eton or Harrow acted towards
his fellow in a similar way, I <i>think</i> he would be
kicked, and <i>I am sure</i> he would deserve it. I know
of no sort of parallel to all this in history, except it
be David with Uriah the Hittite, and then there
was an Eve in the case, who, I am not aware of,
exists in this case. Remember, also, that I do not
judge the question of abandoning the garrisons or
not: what I judge is the indecision of Government.
They did not dare say “abandon the garrison,” so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
they prevented me leaving for the Equator, with the
determination not to relieve me, and the <i>hope</i> (well!
I will not say what their hope was) (“March, April
... August, why! he ought to have surrendered,
he said, six <i>months</i>”)&mdash;there is my point of complaint.
The second is the FICTION that it is
the Egyptian Government which governs Egypt; it
is a <i>silly</i> story, for every one sees through it. Can
one imagine a greater farce, than Lord Northbrook
asking Towfik for the “assistance of Egyptian
Government to carry out this, or that.” I expect
the two roared with laughter over it (sorry I cannot
manage a sketch of the scene). (Baring would
<i>never</i> laugh, <i>it is too serious</i>, like jesting in church).
The third grievance is that Treaty with Abyssinia,
under the screen of the “FICTION,” (if it is <i>true</i>
it has been made); <i>however it is a dead letter</i>, I am
glad to say.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 9th.</i>&mdash;Four soldiers, five slaves, of
whom two are women, came in, from the Arabs
to-day. Desultory firing <i>on</i> and <i>from</i> the Arabs at
Omdurman, and the White Nile Lines.</p>

<p>Of the men who came in, one is a slave of Slatin
Bey. The Mahdi does not mean to fight <i>direct</i>; the
Khalifas<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and the Arabs want to fight direct. Omdurman
killed some of their men; the Arabs have
munitions; Slatin is in chains. These men brought
in their rifles. The Arabs lost at Bourré heavily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
some bodies came floating down the river to-day.
A soldier came in from the Arabs. A few Arabs
came and fired on the fort at Omdurman, and
wounded a slave in it.</p>

<p>The people up here would reason thus, if I attempted
to leave: “You came up here, and had you
not come, we should have some of us got away to
Cairo, but we trusted in you to extricate us; we
suffered and are suffering great privations, in order
to hold the town. Had you not come we should have
given in at once and obtained pardon; now we can,
after our obstinate defence, expect no mercy from
the Mahdi, who will avenge on us all the blood
which has been spilt around Kartoum. You have
taken our money and promised to repay us; all this
goes for nought if you quit us; it is your bounden
duty to stay by us, and to share our fate; if the
British Government deserts us that is no reason for
you to do so, after our having stood by you.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> I
declare <i>positively</i>, and <i>once for all, that I will not
leave the Soudan until every one who wants to go down
is given the chance to do so, unless</i> a government is
established, which relieves me of the charge; therefore
if any emissary or letter comes up here ordering
me to come down, <span class="smcap">I will not obey it, but will
stay here, and fall with the town, and run all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
risks</span>. These remarks are produced by the extraordinary
confidence of the Arabs, combined with the
Abyssinian Treaty and other significant remarks in
the newspaper Kitchener sent me&mdash;Gordon Relief
Expedition&mdash;who, I expect knows <i>more</i> than I do,
and that “<span class="smcap">that more</span> <i>is that the Expedition has come
up for me personally</i>.” I hope, if things do come to
the worst, and that the Expedition goes back, my
steamers (<i>after abstraction</i> of the <i>Fellaheen troops</i>)
will be sent back to this place, with £150,000 which
Baring promised me! (or as much as I wanted), and
as much provisions as can be possibly spared; also a
gun to replace the one lost (or said to be lost) in the
<i>Abbas</i> trying to <i>communicate with Europe</i> and <i>Cairo</i>.
Unless Zubair is absolutely required at Cairo, I
would also like him to come up, or (<i>to save appearances</i>)
allowed to escape. I hope that Stewart’s
supposed death, if <i>by treachery</i>, will be avenged in a
signal way, on the way down.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>A boy was captured, during the cow business at
Omdurman, but he said his father was with the
Arabs, so I let him go back.</p>

<p>I have now got all the “telegrams,” European,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
“<i>sent from</i>” and “<i>received in Soudan</i>” for “1883-84,”&mdash;splendid
collection, full of interest. What would
the <i>Standard</i> give for them? However, I think I
can afford to be generous, and so I shall send
them down with this Vol. VI.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>The fort at Omdurman captured twenty-one cows
this evening; this is splendid&mdash;forty-one cows in
two days.</p>

<p>The only original document I kept here, and which
I was as near as possible giving to Stewart, is the
Firman I have already mentioned, which I send with
this,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> proclaiming the abandonment of the Soudan
by Towfik.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> If the Mahdi had got this he would
have crowed, though he may know of it, for I
showed it, not knowing well its contents, to Hussein
Pasha Khalifa (<i>vide</i> Stewart’s Journal, which went
down, and in which I criticise my having done so).
I felt inclined to give it to Stewart, who, I felt confident,
would get down, because I thought if found
with me the Mahdi might say, “Why, you had the
order to give up the country from Towfik, and you
did not”; but, then, I thought as I shall be killed ere
he takes the town it does not make much difference
if here or with Stewart, so I kept it. I call attention to
the fact that <i>every document</i> (except above-mentioned
telegrams, of which Stewart had taken copies) went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
down with him (Stewart), and that will show how
sure I felt that he and Power would get down, for
otherwise, if I had doubted, I would never have let
my original instructions go; now I have not a <i>single
paper</i>. I cannot quote textually: all went with
Stewart; but I have my memory, and I even give
you the <i>Telegrams</i>. I have not written any dispatch
concerning Stewart or Power. I dare not,
with my views, say their death is an evil;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> if true.
I am sorry for their friends and relations. Stewart
was a brave, just, upright gentleman. Can one say
more? Power was a chivalrous, brave, honest
gentleman. Can one say more? Herbin, I liked
very much; he was a most agreeable and gentlemanly
Frenchman, and very sharp. The diplomatic
... called him <i>names</i> in a telegram; but I found
him fairly just,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> though naturally with a French bias.
For my part I cannot see what harm the French can
do us if they had a voice in Egypt; and I can see
much good arising from it. I declare if they had
had a voice in Egypt the present state of affairs would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
never have existed. If you can find <i>no chivalry</i> in
your own house, you had better borrow it from your
neighbour. We fired yesterday 41,000 rounds of
Remington ammunition, and we fired <i>less</i> than the
Arabs.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 10.</i>&mdash;This morning forty Arabs came
down near Omdurman Fort, and fired on it&mdash;angry
about the capture of cows last evening.</p>

<p>One soldier and one slave came in from the
Arabs at Omdurman. Seven Arabs on camels went
across from the Blue Nile towards Halfeyeh. I fear
a reconnoitring party, previous to their putting a
post there. To day is the day I expected we should
have had some one of the Expedition here. Hicks’
defeat was known at Cairo on the 21st or 22nd
November, since which reinforcements to extent of
nine persons reached this place (up to date) from
Cairo&mdash;“for which the Egyptian Government”
(according to the <span class="smcap">fiction</span>) “is solely and entirely to
blame”!!!!!</p>

<p>The man who was wounded by the mine is dead.
If man knew what the future would bring forth he
would be pretty miserable. Look at the telegram
on other side, written in December 1883.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
not read those telegrams, or Stewart’s Journal, for a
good deal, when I think how we kept feeding on
delusions for so many months. A soldier and slave
have come in from the Arabs at Omdurman; five
more soldiers and three slaves came in later on in
the day; they say Slatin is released from his chains;
that there is a rumour of the advance of the
Expedition direct on Kartoum from Debbeh; that
Luigi and Yusef, two priests, are still in Obeyed,
having refused to become Muslim; that the Arabs
lost heavily at Bourré the day before yesterday.
Why Kitchener<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> did not tell me the route the
Expedition would take is inexplicable, for it
could have done no possible harm, seeing the
Mahdi has his spies everywhere, and it was easy
to have couched this information in terms I could
have understood, and the Mahdi could not have
understood. The Fellaheen soldier did go to the
Mahdi.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 11.</i>&mdash;This morning, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, 200 Arabs
came to north of Omdurman Fort, and fired vollies
towards the village of Tuti and the Fort; the Fort
answered, and the footmen of the Arabs retreated;
then the Arab horsemen made the footmen go back
again, and so on, four or five times; at last they retired.
We had three soldiers and one woman wounded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
only one wound was at all serious. Arabs must
have fired five thousand rounds; evidently they do
not wish much to fight. Nineteen Arabs came
along the right bank of the White Nile from
Halfeyeh to Goba, and captured a donkey, this
even the Shaggyeh could not stand, and so I
suppose one hundred sallied out and some fifteen
horsemen; then came a running fight across the
plain, but it was evident the horsemen would not
head the Arabs; however, from the roof, it was
evident four or five Arabs were killed, and the
pursuit is still going on. You may imagine the
Arabs have a good deal of confidence, for their
nineteen men were distant at least ten miles of
desert from their camp and were at <i>a</i>. They were
going along <i>b b</i> when they were discovered with
the captured donkey. Five at least of these Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
got away. The Arabs are sure to come down to
avenge this. Noon.&mdash;Arabs coming down from
their camp. <i>Ismailia</i> getting steam up. North Fort
reports (?) “Captures, 3 Remingtons! 3 spears!
3 swords! and the killing of 20? 5 got away?” The
Arabs are halted on the sand hills. Five soldiers and
one woman came in from the Arabs at Omdurman,
report, “Arab rocket-tube broken; carriage of gun
broken; the Arabs deserting; rumoured advance
of the expedition; quarrels going on; <i>Slatin in
chains</i>.” The Shaggyeh say they killed twenty
Arabs, but they only say they captured nine arms,
so eleven must have been unarmed!!!</p>

<p>It appears 93,000 okes + 166,000 okes = 259,000
okes of biscuit have been stolen in the last year,
only found out now; however, we have now quarter
of a million okes, which will see us only for a month
or so. It appears that more than thirty of the principal
merchants are engaged in the above robbery
of biscuit. The process is not finished. One of the
greatest problems will be what to do with those
Shaggyeh, those Cairo Bashi Bazouks and fellaheen
soldiers, whose courage is about equal,&mdash;perhaps the
palm is due to the Shaggyeh. The twenty cows I
mentioned as captured by the men of Omdurman
Fort (making up forty-one captured cows, page 309)
<i>were driven in</i> by five soldiers <i>escaping from the Arabs</i>
and <i>were not captured</i>. They do not stick at a lie
(and, in this, resemble some people in high places I
know). 259,000 okes of biscuit was a good haul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
nearly 2½ million pounds: worth £26,000 now, or
£9000 in ordinary times.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 12.</i>&mdash;Last night three slaves came into
Omdurman. At 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> they reported Arabs meant
to attack to-day at dawn. It was reported to me,
but the telegraph clerk did not choose to tell me till
7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to-day. We had been called up at 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
by a violent fusillade at Omdurman. The Arabs
came out in considerable force, and, as I had not
been warned, the steamers had not steam up. From
5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> to 8.30 Arabs came on and went back continually.
All the cavalry were out; the expenditure
of ammunition was immense. The Arabs had
a gun or guns on the bank. Details further on, as
the firing is still going on.</p>

<p>10.20 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;For half-an-hour firing lulled, but
then recommenced, and is still going on. The
<i>Ismailia</i> was struck with a shell, but I hear is
not seriously damaged. The <i>Husseinyeh</i> is aground
(I feel much the want of my other steamers at
Metemma). 11.15 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Firing has lulled; it was
very heavy for the last three-quarters of an hour
from <i>Ismailia</i> and Arabs; it is now desultory, and is
dying away. <i>Husseinyeh</i> is still aground. The
<i>Ismailia</i> is at anchor. What a six hours of anxiety
for me, when I saw the shells strike the water near
the steamers from the Arabs; imagine my feelings!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
We have £831 in specie and £42,800 in paper; and
there is £14,600 in <i>paper</i> out in the town! I call
this state of finance not bad, after more than eight
months’ blockade. The troops are owed half a
month’s pay, and even that can be scarcely called
owed them, for I have given them stores, and beyond
the regulations. Noon.&mdash;The firing has ceased, I am
glad to say. I have lived <i>years</i> in these last <i>hours</i>!
Had I lost the <i>Ismailia</i>, I should have lost the
<i>Husseinyeh</i> (aground), and then Omdurman, and the
North Fort! And then the Town! 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;The
Arabs are firing on the steamers with their two
guns. The <i>Husseinyeh, still aground</i>; that is the
reason of it. Firing, 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, now has ceased. The
<i>Ismailia</i>, struck by three shells, had one man killed,
fifteen wounded on board of her; she did really very
well. I boxed the telegraph clerk’s ears for not
giving me the telegram last night (after repeated
orders that no consideration was to prevent his
coming to me); and then, as my conscience pricked
me, I gave him $5. He said he did not mind if I
killed him&mdash;I was his father (a chocolate-coloured
youth of twenty). I know all this is brutal&mdash;<i>abrutissant</i>,
as Hansall calls it&mdash;but what is one
to do? If you cut their pay, you hurt their
families. I am an advocate for summary and quick
punishment, which hurts only the defaulter. Had
this clerk warned me, of course at daybreak, the
steamers would have had their steam up, and been
ready.  We have a Krupp at Mogrim Fort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Ferratch Pasha reports he has dismounted one of
the Arab guns. The Arabs had a show of four hundred
horsemen, who kept far off. Telegraph was,
and is, interrupted between this and the Omdurman
Fort (whether by bullet or otherwise is not known
as yet). Considering that the Arab mountain gun
can (and has) made holes <i>two feet square</i> in the
steamer, my anxiety is not to be wondered at. (I
feel as if I had walked thirty miles.) We fired eighty-three
rounds of Krupp at the Arabs from Mogrim,
forty-three rockets. The Arabs fired three hundred
and seventy rounds from their guns at the steamers.
As for ammunition (Remington), we fired from <i>our
steamers</i>, forts, &amp;c., fifty thousand rounds; and I
certainly think the Arabs fired as much, Omdurman
certainly was “<span class="smcap">over-eager to fire on the enemy</span>”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
in the early dawn, and consequently wasted ammunition.
This ends the greatest battle (<i>as yet</i>) of our
second blockade. Spies (of last night) say it was
undertaken against the Mahdi’s wish, by his Khalifa
or Vizier, who persuaded him to allow it. During
all through, the Arabs of the South and East never
moved a peg. Like the Chinese, one may calculate,
they will never assist one another.</p>

<p>This is our <i>first</i> encounter with the Mahdi’s
personal troops. One tumbles at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> into a
troubled sleep; a drum beats&mdash;tup! tup! tup! It
comes into a dream, but after a few moments one
becomes more awake, and it is revealed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
brain that <i>one is in Kartoum</i>. The next query is,
where is this tup, tupping going on. A hope arises
it will die away. No, it goes on, and increases in
intensity. The thought strikes one, “Have they
enough ammunition?” (the excuse of bad soldiers).
One exerts oneself. At last, it is no use, up one
must get, and go on to the roof of the palace; then
telegrams, orders, swearing, and cursing goes on
till about 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Men may say what they like
about glorious war, but to me it is a horrid nuisance
(if it is permitted to say anything is a nuisance
which comes on us). I saw that poor little beast
the <i>Husseinyeh</i> (a Thames launch) fall back, stern
foremost, under a terrific fire of breechloaders. I
saw a shell strike the water at her bows; I saw her
stop and puff off steam, and I gave the glass to my
boy, <i>sickened unto death</i>, and I will say my thoughts
turned on ... more than on anyone, and they are
not beneficent towards him. My boy (he is thirty)
said, “<i>Husseinyeh is sick</i>.” I knew it, but said
quietly, “Go down and telegraph to Mogrim,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> ‘Is
<i>Husseinyeh</i> sick?’” Answer, “No.” I asked
again; answer, “No.” Then telegraph said, “She
was aground.”</p>

<p>2.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The <i>Ismailia</i> tried to take <i>Husseinyeh</i>
off, and got struck twice, in addition to the three
times before mentioned, with shells, so she desisted
from the attempt. The Arabs are firing on the
<i>Husseinyeh</i>. I have ordered the Krupp of Mogrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to play on the Arab guns, and shall wait till night
to take off the <i>Husseinyeh</i>. She is nearer to the <i>left</i>
bank than to the <i>right</i> bank; it is not clear if she is
aground or half sunk (equally a trouble). 3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
The Arabs are bringing their guns nearer to the
aground or half-sunken <i>Husseinyeh</i>. The <i>Ismailia</i>
reports that the two last shells have done her no
material damage. 4.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs have now
three guns bearing on the <i>Husseinyeh</i>. 6 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The
firing has ceased. I hope to get the <i>Husseinyeh</i> off
at night. 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs keep up a dropping
fire on the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, who, I hear, has two shell
holes in her, and has six men, including the captain,
wounded. I must say the Arabs to-day showed
the greatest of pluck; over and over again they
returned to the attack, though overwhelmed with
the musketry fire of the castellated <i>Ismailia</i>. I
think they must have lost heavily, for at times they
were in dense groups. I believe that by the <i>Arabs</i>
we may understand <i>our own regulars captured in
Kordofan and Darfur, &amp;c.</i> We are going to get
the <i>Husseinyeh</i> off to-night <i>if we can</i>. No Royal
Navy vessels would have behaved better than the
<i>Ismailia</i> to-day; she passed and repassed the Arab
guns upwards of twenty times, when any one well-placed
shell would have sunk her. Whether the
crew knew it or not does not matter. <i>I did, and
felt comfortable accordingly.</i> The Arab guns were
not 1,200 yards distant from her, and even less at
times. She was struck five times with shell. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
that the <i>Ismailia</i>, is only a superior penny
boat, and that the Egyptian mountain gun is as
superior to our wretched seven-pounders as a three-pounder
is to a twelve-pounder Howitzer, both for
range and for effect. You want a gun to make a
hole, not a gimlet-hole, which these seven-pounders
do, and what wearisome work to carry them!</p>

<p>All this worry is (humanly speaking) due to that
chocolate-coloured clerk of the telegraph not warning
me. This evening there was an ominous sign
that the Arabs on the Blue Nile knew of our
troubles with the <i>Husseinyeh</i>. They came up
against Bourré, but two gunshots drove them off.
At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Arabs on the right bank of the White
Nile fired twelve shells against the Lines, and opened
a fire of musketry for a short time, but did no harm.
I have given half a month’s pay to the <i>Ismailia</i> and
to the <i>Husseinyeh</i> crews, and $2 for the men who
have gone to get the latter off; she is <i>not half sunk</i>,
but <i>is aground</i>. There is (8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) a fire on the left
bank of the White Nile, opposite to Halfeyeh.
The Arabs got into the ditch of the entrenched
camp at Omdurman, which is theirs. We only
occupy the fort <span class="smcap">x</span>. Hicks’ army were in this entrenched
camp. Arabs came to <span class="smcap">y</span>.</p>

<p>8.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs have still their guns on the
river bank, and are firing at the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, whom
I am trying, by my men, to get off. Evidently they
are not cowed, for generally they take their guns
back at night to their camp. Report from <i>Husseinyeh</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
steamer:&mdash;-10.20 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, Wounded, 6; killed, 3;
efforts as yet are ineffectual as to taking off the
steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 13.</i>&mdash;The <i>Ismailia</i>, 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, got struck
by <i>two shells</i> (?)<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> going to take off the <i>Husseinyeh</i>,
so we took her gun out, and her crew, and have left
her. At 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, the Arabs commenced firing on
the Lines at Bourré, and 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I see they are coming
across to Goba, bringing a gun with them. The
Arabs at Omdurman are quiet. The Arabs have fired
five times with their gun at the Omdurman Fort.
The Arabs have got their gun at the village outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Sheikh Ali, near the end of the Lines on the White
Nile, and have fired shells at the Lines. Our telegraph
was cut yesterday evening with Omdurman
Fort, and cannot be repaired (8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>), for the Arabs
are shelling that fort. The Arabs, on the North Side,
have their gun on the low sandhills some 4,000
yards off, and are shelling us; musketry firing going
on at Bourré. The Arabs had their guns last night
defending the approach to the <i>Husseinyeh</i>. We are
repairing the <i>Ismailia</i>; the barricade of the steersman
of the <i>Husseinyeh</i> got struck by a shell. We
raised a parapet on the river bank to defend any
approach of the Arabs to <i>Husseinyeh</i>. Omdurman
had yesterday a quarter of a million cartridges&mdash;Remington.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Omdurman Fort has one and a half month’s supply
of food and water; it was a fault to place it so far
from the river;<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> yesterday it had not its flag up;
to-day it has. The Arabs have sent 250 men to
Goba; but the village Hogali, which was the one
close to the palace, having been levelled, they are
too far off to do us any harm. There is a report in
town, the Arabs say they will enter it to-morrow,
and say their prayers in the mosque on Friday.
The Arabs at Goba are wasting a lot of ammunition
(Remington), their bullets do not reach us.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> They
will be bothered for water, for we filled up all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
wells in Goba. 9.15 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The Arabs have returned
from Goba. 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> They have made a
long <i>détour</i>,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and have gone to the prolongation of
our lines at Bourré, on the right bank of the Blue
Nile, where they are firing heavily. I expect we
fired 50,000 rounds yesterday, and the Arabs rather
more, while to-day the Arabs have fired a great
deal. We calculate that with Hicks’ army was lost
1,000,000 cartridges, and now it is a year ago,
during which time, with the firing there and elsewhere
during a year, two-thirds of that million must
have been expended, and they have no means to
renew the cartridges; they cannot have much more
than 300,000 rounds.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-393.jpg" width="400" height="336"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The Arabs have now gone from opposite Bourré
(11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>), having fired a nice lot of ammunition,
and hurt no one in the fort. Omdurman Fort is
still cut off from us; Arabs at <span class="smcap">a b c</span>. The Arabs
certainly got the best of it yesterday, though I expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
they paid for it. It appears the <i>Husseinyeh</i>
got aground through the captain, who was afterwards
wounded, not doing what the Reis told him.
Fortunately I had foreseen the likelihood of the fort
at Omdurman being cut off, and had provisioned it.
If the expedition comes at all, it ought to be here
before long. We had fifteen men wounded yesterday,
three rather dangerously, and seven were
killed. I never feel anxious about any of the fights,
except when the steamers are engaged, and then I
own I am on tenterhooks as long as they are out.
1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs have got four guns down on the
river, and are firing across the river at the Mogrim
Fort, which is answering by Krupp and rockets.
We are not fortunate with the little steamers I
had brought out in sections from England; we have
lost, at any rate <i>temporarily</i>, one, the <i>Husseinyeh</i>;
another, the <i>Abbas</i>, where is she? And the Arabs
have the third, the <i>Mahomet Ali</i>, on the Blue Nile.
The Arabs fired four guns on the lines near the
White Nile this morning (they fired sixty rounds).
Musketry (3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) going on across river between our
men and the Arabs. Certainly we have been left to
almost the very last extremity, and I declare I think
the year will be complete, from the time Cairo heard
of Hicks’ defeat, to the time of the relief expedition
arriving here!!! And I am sure, if an enquiry was
made, it would be made out no one was to blame.</p>

<p>The Arabs have eighteen boats plying as ferry
from one side of the White Nile to the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
They may try with these boats to get hold of the
<i>Husseinyeh</i>, or else to board her; there are only
some bags of biscuits on board; but as the steamer
is blinded, if Arabs once get on board, it would be
very difficult to dislodge them, unless we sink the
steamer, for they will find the biscuit and so have
plenty to eat. Fifteen shells fell into the town
this morning, but did no harm.</p>

<p>Nearly all the Arab force which came on the
north side to-day were slaves, with them perhaps
forty horsemen Arabs. Eventually the Arabs will
find out the inconvenience of these Mamelukes.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Four bullets came from the Arabs to the Palace
to-day&mdash;2800 yards&mdash;and came with a good force.
A native of Kartoum came and complained he had
had nothing to eat for himself and family for four
days; they found eight ardebs of dhoora in his
house; in another house forty ardebs were found.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 14.</i>&mdash;8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The Arabs on both sides
of the Blue Nile began firing on Bourré at 5.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,
and it is going on now. They kept up for more
than quarter of an hour a continuous roll of fire, and
have wasted a precious lot of ammunition. They
brought down one of their guns and fired a few
rounds. Up to this time no one is wounded at
Bourré.</p>

<p>Two men crossed from Omdurman, and report
Ferratch Ullah as all right, and as having no men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
wounded in the fort. The Arabs fired their guns on
the fort this morning.</p>

<p>An Arab tried to swim off to the <i>Husseinyeh</i>,
whom (<i>they say?</i>) our men shot.</p>

<p>I wonder where King John is, with his 200,000
soldiers?</p>

<p>I argue thus: 1. It would be impossible for the
Expeditionary Force, once having come to Dongola,
not to move up to Metemma, or to the vicinity of
Berber. 2. That once at Metemma, or at Berber,
they will find the steamers, and consequently must
communicate with Kartoum. 3. Once they communicate
with Kartoum they must assume the
responsibility of the government of that place (of
course, when once that responsibility is assumed, the
decision as to what they will do rests with them).</p>

<p>4. It is impossible for them to loiter long on the
road between Dongola (or Debbeh) and Metemma.</p>

<p>5. It will be impossible for them, <i>owing to the events of
the last few days</i>,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> to avoid collision with the Arabs
around Kartoum. A week ago it might have been
possible, but now the Arabs are too close to the
town to avoid it. Omdurman Fort being cut off
will oblige action being taken to re-open communications.
The Arabs <i>may run away</i>, but, somehow,
since a few days, I doubt it.</p>

<p>A soldier came in from the North Fort from the
Arabs this morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Another fib</i>&mdash;they told me that they had got
everything out of the <i>Husseinyeh</i> but the biscuit: it
appears that the ammunition is still in her.</p>

<p>No church parade on the right bank of Nile
(Kalakla), but one is going on at Giraffe on the Blue
Nile. It appears last night that a boat went off to the
<i>Husseinyeh</i>, that the men in this boat got frightened
at the challenge of our own men and jumped
into the water, and left their boat. I went down to
Mogrim, and found the <i>Ismailia</i> has been struck by
seven shells, and is pockmarked with bullets all over.
The Arabs (some 400 rifles) line a long trench opposite
the <i>Husseinyeh</i>: we have erected a parapet on
our side opposite her. The Arabs have four guns,
from which they kept up a desultory fire, doing no
harm. The Arabs’ rifle-fire is continuous and futile,
ours is less heavy, but I expect equally futile, for the
Arabs keep under cover. The Arabs fired regular
volleys, upwards of five, while I was there: they
appear to delight in the noise. The <i>Husseinyeh</i> is
about 1,200 yards from the point <span class="smcap">x</span>, 800 yards from
<span class="smcap">y</span>, and 1,000 yards to <span class="smcap">z</span>, where my trench is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Husseinyeh</i> lies just off the end of the entrenchment
of Omdurman <i>entrenched camp</i>.</p>

<p>She has her stern to the Arabs.</p>

<p>A soldier came in to the North Fort from the
Arabs on the Blue Nile, and reports that a man
with letters came the night before last to the fort
of Omdurman and called out to the sentries, but
before they could let him into the fort the Arabs
captured him and the letters. I hope to be able
to-night to communicate by bugle sounds with
Omdurman Fort.</p>

<p>Revised list of the robbery; 172,000 okes of
biscuit they change every day. We have to-day
in the magazine 240,000 okes of biscuit, 1,326 ardebs
of dhoora. Have ordered 1000 okes to be given
away, and 4000 okes to be sold.</p>

<p>The Omdurman Fort is ill placed, as it cannot see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
the ground down to the river, and is distant 1200
yards from the river. The Arabs on left bank of
the White Nile opposite <i>Husseinyeh</i> number 500
(I expect all are my soldiers), and they are so far
away from any reserve that it would be easy to
crush them before they were aided, <i>if we dared to
try</i>, which we do not. I was at Mogrim Fort for
half an hour, during which time the Arabs fired, as
I calculated, fifteen shells and 8000 rounds, and no
one was touched; indeed, where their bullets went I
could not see nor hear. No stores could stand that,
and up to sundown they were still at it with rifles
and guns. Bourré, in spite of all the heavy firing,
has no casualties; 80,000 rounds would scarcely
cover our <i>united</i> expenditure to-day.</p>

<p>Reports from the Arabs at different times said
the Mahdi had brought 200 (some say 120) camel
loads of ammunition (Remingtons) from Obeyed&mdash;say
200, and say that each camel carried 2 boxes,
each box 1000, so that he had, before he began,
800,000 rounds; he must have expended in the last
week 250,000 to 300,000 rounds, and has left 550,000
rounds or 500,000 rounds. I do not expect he has
200,000 rounds left, which is his weekly expenditure
if he goes on at the rate he is going now. We turn
out on an average 40,000 rounds a week, and are
well ahead of our requirements. Looking at the
Arab gunners with my telescope, they never seem to
bother themselves about aim, but just to load and
fire. It is, of course, different when the steamers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
are in action. The officer in command of Mogrim
Fort was wounded in the arm at sundown. The
captain of <i>Husseinyeh</i> died to-day. We suppose that
on board the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, are the men I mentioned
as having jumped out of the boat last night on the
challenge of the sentry, also a soldier of Omdurman
who swam off to her with letters from Ferratch Bey,
commandant of the fort, so we are sending off a
boat to <i>Husseinyeh</i> to take them off. A workman in
the arsenal was wounded to-day by a ball from Bourré,
distant 2300 yards. The Arab fire on Bourré renders
the vicinity of the palace far more dangerous
than Bourré, the balls fall so plentifully around the
Mudirat, which is close by, that the Greek consul
was obliged to lay to for some time till the firing
ceased: it is at least 2500 to 3000 yards from the
palace to the place the Arabs fire from.</p>

<p>We have put the gun of the steamer <i>Ismailia</i> on
the bank of the Nile, to cover the approach to
the <i>Husseinyeh</i>; the Greek consul says “the balls
fall like water” on the road leading to the palace.
I believe a good deal, if you have the ammunition, in
the dropping fire of rifles, even at three thousand
yards; the balls that fell on the palace are fairly
flattened, showing they have plenty of life to kill.
The buglers have communicated with Fort Omdurman,
who are all well. 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> to-morrow we will
have signals with flags. Out of evil comes good&mdash;if
<i>Husseinyeh</i> was not aground, the Arabs, instead of
concentrating their force and attention on her, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
have devoted it on the fort, which, cut off, would
suffer; as it is now, the fort is unmolested. Bullets
rained on the hospital yesterday and to-day, but did
no harm! I calculate that the <i>Ismailia</i> has two
thousand bullet marks on her.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 15.</i>&mdash;Last night we sent off a boat to
the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, and took off the soldier of Ferratch
Ullah Bey, who had come from Omdurman, also the
ten men who jumped into the water from their boat
the night before. Ferratch Ullah writes he is all
well; he wants ammunition!!! he had 230,000 rounds
three days ago: he says he has now 150,000 rounds,
also he has regulars, 470, each 100 rounds, 47,000;
he has irregulars, 170, each 200 rounds, 34,000
altogether; in magazine of fort, 150,000 rounds,
and with the men 81,000; total ammunition in fort,
231,000 rounds: yet he calls for ammunition!!!
Hicks took 1,000,000. The buglers communicated
well with the fort at Omdurman; buglers then
spoke the soldiers on Mahdi’s side, but they did
not answer; we invited them to come over to us.</p>

<p>The five feluccas, which took the men off the
<i>Husseinyeh</i>, were not seen by the Arabs. I sent
an engineer to take off the steam-valves of the
<i>Husseinyeh</i>; the five feluccas took off, <i>this time</i>,
everything from <i>Husseinyeh</i>, biscuit, ammunition,
&amp;c., &amp;c. It appears that the Arabs, who were
watching the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, had gone off to Kerowé,
opposite Halfeyeh; but this is doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>At dawn the Arabs opened a heavy fire with the
usual futile efforts on Bourré, also they fired with
gun and musketry on Omdurman Fort.</p>

<p>At Omdurman Fort they have had, in the last
few days, four killed and sixteen wounded.</p>

<p>A shell from the Arabs struck <i>Husseinyeh</i> yesterday,
but did no harm, for she is well aground.
No wounded at Bourré to-day by the Arab fire.</p>

<p>The Bimbashi, who was wounded in the arm
yesterday evening, was lying on his angarep<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> when
he was wounded: he thought it a secure place; he
died to-day.</p>

<p>The Arabs from Omdurman side of the river have
kept up a desultory fire of guns and musketry all
day; but at sundown the fire was much heavier, and
if the Arabs go on like that for many days, they
will be out of ammunition, both gun and rifle.</p>

<p>It has turned out a benefit for us the <i>Husseinyeh</i>
going aground, for the attention of the Arabs is devoted
to her, and they fire scarcely at all on the fort
at Omdurman; even if we had her, she could do
little good: the other little steamer will be completed
in twelve days.</p>

<p>I think I have been rather unjust towards the
fellaheen soldier, for though he is not brave enough
to take the field, he has done good work on board
the steamers, and a good many of their officers and
men have been killed and wounded (thanks to the
policy that has been followed elsewhere) in a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
which does not concern them. These remarks
are produced by a visit I made to the hospital to-day,
when I saw the mass of the wounded were
fellaheen soldiers, whom I put in the steamers,
because, when in action, they could not run away,
while I kept the blacks for the defence of the Lines.
As I was leaving the hospital to-day, a dead man
was carried out by four men in chains (convicts) on
a stretcher, accompanied by two soldiers with fixed
bayonets&mdash;to be buried as a dog! This is part of
the glory of war! According to the demands for
ammunition, we are firing away 40,000 rounds per
diem; the officers ask for fresh Remingtons, as by
the constant firing those they have are out of order.
I feel quite indifferent, for, if not relieved for a
month, our food supply fails, and even at the above
rate of expenditure of ammunition we have fifty
days’ cartridges. I like to go down with our colours
flying. The Arabs are quite equalling us in expenditure,
and they have no reserve of ammunition,
or means of repairing their arms. I am going to
call the new steamer the <i>Zubair</i>, after Zubair Pasha
Rahama;<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> the town wanted it called after me, but I
said, “I have put most of you in prison and otherwise
bullied you, and I have no fear of your
forgetting me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November16.</i>&mdash;The Arabs quiet, little firing at
Mogrim; I expect the Mahdi has found out that his
men have been making away with his ammunition
too fast, even as I have found it out. A small
fantasie or church parade is going on near the
Mahdi’s camp this morning.</p>

<p>The Arabs at the Mahdi’s camp have moved the
camp further inland; they did this at sundown
yesterday. It is on the <i>tapis</i> that they may retire
altogether; if so it will be glorious. The camp
opposite the Lines on South is much diminished, not
more than five or six tents. The Arabs there have
gone to Giraffe and El foun on the Blue Nile. With
the exception of the Arab guns firing on Mogrim,
and our guns answering, everything is quiet to-day.
In a couple of hours the Arabs fired sixteen shells
without the least effect. Their gun ammunition
must be nearly expended. A woman was slightly
wounded at Bourré this morning. The Arabs work
on a regular principle with the captured black
troops. They know that they will escape to us if
they can, in the first instance, so they keep them on
short rations, and promise them full rations if they
fight us. They then force them into contact with
us for (at first) appearance sake and to get the full
rations; when in contact with us we fire on and
kill some of them, then their black blood gets up,
and they retaliate <i>en bonne volonté</i>, and are egged
on by the Arabs, who say to them, “Now you have
fired on the Government troops you are in for it; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Government will never pardon you,” and so thus we
get no more deserters. It was the same way at
Bourré, before we fired on the Arabs we got plenty
of deserters, but when once we gave them a slating
no more came in; they are compromised with the
Mahdi’s cause, and afraid of us if they come in.
The Janissaries were the children of Christian
parents captured when young, and they fought with
vigour against the Christians when they grew up.
Scarcely ever is the true Arab in the front, so they
say.</p>

<p>We have ninety men in hospital at present, of
which fifty-four are wounded. We had one man
killed, and one wounded at Mogrim to-day. A
woman was wounded in the town yesterday. Report
in town says seventy of our captured soldiers have
deserted and have entered the fort at Omdurman.</p>

<p>Having been assured by my officers that it was a
most terrible risk even to go along the bank near
the <i>Husseinyeh</i>, even by night, owing to the Arabs’
rifle fire, and being extremely sceptical of the past
(putting down the information given me as an
excuse for doing nothing towards taking off the
<i>Husseinyeh</i> the first night she got aground; and
also as an effort to enhance the danger and daring
of those men who did take off the ammunition, &amp;c.,
the night before last), I went down to-night at
11.30 and found it was all a myth, and that if I
wished I could take her off without any risk.
However, as she is a target and occupies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
attention of the Arabs, who leave the fort at
Omdurman alone in consequence of her, I shall
leave her as she is. Of course, needless to say, I
found all the officers in charge absent; <i>they had gone
home to bed!</i> However, I am not put out at it.
They are, as a rule, the <i>very feeblest of the conies</i>, and
nothing will change their nature. The <i>Husseinyeh</i>
lies close to the junction of the White and Blue Niles,
and one may say is within our lines.</p>

<p>I daresay this is a repetition, but if we do get out
of this mess it is a miracle, for I do not think a
slacker lot of officers ever could be found, but a
bad workman always complains of his tools. A
good workman turns out good work however rotten
his tools may be.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November17.</i>&mdash;It is really amusing to find (when
one can scarcely call one’s life one’s own) one’s
servant, <i>already</i> with one wife (which most men find
is enough), coming and asking for leave for three
days, in order to take another wife. Yet such was
the case, a few days ago, with one of my servants.</p>

<p>The Arabs this morning fired from their guns from
Bourré, from the White Nile, and from Omdurman;
they are also keeping up a musketry fire. At the
Mahdi’s camp they had another “church parade”
to-day. I suppose they are working up their
fanaticism. The Arabs have a Nordenfeldt opposite
the little steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i>. The town people are
pleased at the new steamer being called the <i>Zubair</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the Anti-Slave Society will be furious.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> If Zubair
had come up, I should have had news long before
now.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It does seem ridiculous that when our apparent
policy is to hand over the Soudan to the Mahdi,
who with his people are far more slave hunters than
Zubair ever would be, we should not have utilized
this man in this expedition. There are about two
hundred people on the Isle of Tuti, yet last night an
Arab came over, killed a man and carried off three
donkeys; they do not deserve the name of men.
How Zubair would touch up these fellows; he would
go to Tuti and give all the men between eighteen
and fifty at least thirty blows of Kourbatch. I am
obliged to content myself with lamentations.</p>

<p>(“Count the months&mdash;March, April, May, June,
July, August, September, October, and half November!
Why, I declare, it is a breach of contract.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>)</p>

<p>If it be true about the repulse of the Abyssinians
at Keren, I expect there were roars of laughter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Downing Street at the greenness of His Majesty
the Emperor John (as Mitzakis calls him). It is
very odd, but we have had no news of Kassala for
months, not since September ... to .... “You said
<i>it was too dreadful</i>; what will you say when I tell
you he has made sketches of <i>you</i> and ME? and
how, horrible to relate, put them in his demi-official
journal; and we can do <i>absolutely</i> nothing, for if he
is attacked as being a British officer, he says he
made the sketches as Governor-General, and <i>vice
versâ</i>.”</p>

<p>Independent of my regret for Stewart, the loss of
his journal affects me, for there were lots of things
in it of interest. All the powers (including the
Pope, and excluding England and France) were
appealed to in a touching memo., to raise an auxiliary
force under Baker, &amp;c., &amp;c., and to stop the wave of
Dervish fanaticism. I also wrote to the Sultan. I
do not know if these appeals ever got through, but
Stewart had them all copied in his journal. Events
and my discourses had almost made him latterly, as
vicious as I am. Baring’s ears ought to have burned,
for the last eight months, he was nicely dissected by
us all (Power aiding). If Herbin, the French
Consul, had got down Baring would have had a time
of it, for Herbin says that Barère, the French
minister, went to Baring before Herbin left, and
Baring did not tell (Barère) any thing about the
evacuation of the Soudan. Of course Baring will
shelter himself under the “fiction” that he, as British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
minister, had nothing to do with it. What a farce,
if it did not deal with men’s lives.</p>

<p>When one thinks that Baring works harder than a
galley slave for such wretched results, one ought to
pity him.</p>

<p>I have sent 150 of these superior troops (the
Shaggyeh), to the Isle of Tuti, in consequence of the
outrage of last night (which I do not believe in, <i>for
that one man came over and killed another man, and
carried off three donkeys in a small boat</i> is absurd).
However, the Shaggyeh are safer in the Isle of Tuti
than in the North Fort. At 7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Arabs came
down and fired on Bourré from the left bank of the
Blue Nile. The officer (a full colonel of <i>my</i>
creation), asks me “Is he to fire back?” I said,
“Better <i>not</i> ask me that question, unless you want
to catch it.” 7.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Omdurman Fort is firing
away. I certainly lay claim to having commanded,
more often than any other man, cowardly troops,
but this experience of 1884 beats all past experiences;
the worst of the matter is, that you cannot believe
one word the officers say. With respect to the
major who was absent from the Fort Mogrim last
night, he says he was in the telegraph station, which
is a direct falsehood. However, I did nothing to
him, more than call him a liar, which he probably
considers a compliment. A sort of adjutant-major,
whom I had borne with for a long time, told me <i>two
cold lies</i> in <i>two days</i>, so I bundled him out. Can it
be wondered at that, after nine months and more of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
this sort of military worry, and ditto of civil worry,
I am heartily sick of the whole affair, and provided
<i>I</i> am not made a party (and I <i>will not be</i>) to a
shabby retreat, I should be glad to be out of this
place.</p>

<p>The Arabs fired fifteen shells against the Fort of
Omdurman; only one seemed to strike the keep;
one man was wounded at Mogrim with the splinter
of a shell. The Arab gun-carriages must be in bad
state of repair, for our carpenters are continually
at work making new ones, and the Arabs have no
means of so doing. The <i>Husseinyeh</i> lies just off the
division of the White and the Blue Niles, and not as
I showed her position, page 327. All the scratched
out portion is abuse of Baring.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Some one said, “If
you feel angry, then write your angry letter, and then
tear it up.” It certainly does relieve the mind to
write one’s bile, and it is good also to scratch it out,
for I dare say Baring is doing his duty better than I
am; he is certainly more patriotic, if patriotism
consists in obedience to the existing Government of
one’s country.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p>Doctor reports that the shells and bullets of the
Arabs fell all around the hospital this morning, but
did no harm, they came from Bourré.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 18.</i>&mdash;Everything quiet all round the
place; they fired a few shots with their guns at the
lines near the White Nile.</p>

<p>11.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The Arabs on the right bank of the
Blue Nile have moved towards the north, and, from
the number of porters, I expect they are going to
form a camp to the north.</p>

<p>It may be turned as one likes; three prominent
undeniable facts exist. Her Majesty’s Government
refused to help Egypt with respect to the Soudan,
refused to let Egypt help herself, and refused to
allow any other power to help her: this cannot be disputed
or explained away. Lord Dufferin’s despatch
was “hands off.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The resignation of Cherif was the
prohibition of allowing Egypt to help herself. This
tardy succour under pressure, and Baring’s despatch,
establishes the unwillingness to help.</p>

<p>The Arabs have settled down in the old Dem
they occupied in March last!! opposite the palace,
and which they evacuated in August; their vicinity
will give us more spies, which we have lacked
hitherto; this proceeding does not show as if they
were much appalled at the advance of the expeditionary
force. On the 12th March they pitched
their tents on the very spot they are pitching them
now&mdash;251 days ago&mdash;during which we have night
and day been in hostilities with them, and been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
obliged to keep on the alert “because of?” “because
of?”&mdash;“What?” The answer has been worn
threadbare.</p>

<p>The Arab guns on Omdurman side firing 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
on Mogrim. They have expended a lot of gun
ammunition in last few days. 3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> They are
still firing; one can distinguish the Nordenfeldt. I
remember how, when Hicks left for the Soudan,
papers wrote of the great effect that the Nordenfeldts
were to have upon Arabs, like the French
before the Franco-Prussian war with their mitrailleuses.
At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> they fired for a quarter of an hour
quickly. This was caused by five cows which approached
the Fort, the men of which killed three
(so to-night they will have meat). The Arabs fired
fifteen shells one after the other against the Fort,
for the outrage on their property. I shall have to
move these superior troops (the Shaggyeh) out of
the North Fort, for the approach of the Arabs has
filled them with dismay. I have kept moving them
from every place the Arabs came near. It is really
absurd that one should have to pay and keep such
troops. I will say Ferratch Pasha (however irritating
he is in some ways) is always the gentleman,
which I am sorry to say <i>I am not</i>, with the fury I
get in on state occasions. A woman came in from
the south front; she says they were all my old
soldiers who are fighting on the left bank of the
Nile, and that they lost heavily on the day <i>Husseinyeh</i>
got aground.  I am moving <i>these</i> Shaggyeh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to the lines; it is no use exposing them to be attacked.
The Arabs now on the north front opposite the
palace are the men of the Mahdi, not as before the
men of the Sheikh el Obeyed, who do not seem
to have entered cordially into the second blockade
of Kartoum. We had to-night the Arab forces all
around us, and are regularly hemmed in, but the
town does not care a bit, and are fighting questions
of pay with me, for I am paying in paper the three
months’ backsheesh I promised them.</p>

<p>The major who was shot when lying on his
angarep, and who died of his wound, was 3,000
yards distant from the Arabs. We do not know
yet the effect of the rifle in a dropping fire. I
offered, in paying the three months’ backsheesh to
the troops, to give orders for bulk sums £120, £130,
but they refused to accept them; they want the
<i>regular paper money</i>, so I have issued £10,000 more
in £50 notes. In this paper money notes <i>I am
personally responsible</i> for the liquidation, and any one
may bring an action against me, <i>in my individual
capacity</i>, to recover the money, while in the orders
it might be a query whether they (the authorities of
Cairo) might not decline to pay the orders. Paper
money now cannot be bought at a discount. People
have tried to buy it up, but they failed.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> I consider
this is very satisfactory for one’s credit. Her Majesty’s
Government, as well as the Soudan people, will not
need to name a vessel after me in order to remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
me, even if they felt so disposed, which I very much
doubt. We shall get lots of spies in now the Arabs
have hemmed us in. In these deserts, if you leave
a space unguarded you see at once any one moving
over it; but if you surround it entirely, there is the
usual going to and fro, and thus a spy slips in. I do
not think it is realised what happened in Hicks’ defeat
a year ago. 10,000 soldiers, including 2,000 cavalry,
4,000 camp-followers, 7,000 camels, perished in
two days from thirst;<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> 1700 rifles, 1,000,000 rounds
Remington ammunition, were captured; 7 Krupps,
6 Nordenfeldts, 29 mountain guns, with 500 rounds
each, were captured (perhaps 300 men were spared
out of the host). Eight Englishmen and 8 Germans
were killed, and, according to all accounts, they were
so exhausted that they were unable to move. Stewart
took great pains to get all the details, and wrote
them in his journal. The Arabs have made a pyramid
of the skulls. The major who was wounded at
Mogrim was sleeping in the telegraph station in the
Fort. He found it hot, and went out and got struck
and died. If you went to the Fort at Mogrim you
would (on seeing the position whence the Arabs fire)
say you were as safe there as in Regent Street.
This man was a very timorous man, and had avoided
every service of the least danger. It is of no use
fighting against your destiny. The doctor described
to me to-night the state of the town <i>a year ago</i>, when
they heard of the defeat of Hicks; and one compares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
it to our present state, when one may say perfect
confidence exists in the town, and every one has
gone comfortably to bed&mdash;it is a lesson to man to
never despair.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 19.</i>&mdash;The Arabs came down, 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, to
Goba, opposite the Palace, and fired, but did no
harm; they are pulling down Seyd Mahomet
Osman’s house, which was spared. Ferratch Ullah
did not dare to go out for the three cows killed
last night. The Arabs had a bugler of ours with
them at Goba; he bugled a call “1st Regiment!”
and then was apparently stopped, he then bugled
“We are strong! We are strong!” I have packed
up and addressed to the chief of staff, Soudan Expeditionary
Force, “all European telegrams sent <i>from</i>
and received <i>in</i> the Soudan for years 1883-84,” and
send the box with this portion of the Journal.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> The
Arabs have put a gun in the breastwork on the
left bank of the White Nile below Omdurman
Fort, so as to bar the entrance to Kartoum on the
north.</p>

<p>We have communicated with Omdurman Fort
with flags, it is all right. The Arabs are not
firing to-day (since 8.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>). Twelve days have
to elapse ere the month’s rations become due; this
evening it is reported to me that those utterly useless
troops&mdash;some fifty Bashi Bazouks&mdash;began crying
that they had nothing to eat, and even went so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
as to throw down their arms; now this is rather
too much, considering that they are receiving the
full rations of soldiers, and also the pay of men
who are supposed to find themselves, so that it is
a perfectly gratuitous gift to give them rations at
all, or if I do so, I should cut their pay; the best
of it is, that I <i>have given</i> them full rations for the
month, which has twelve days yet to run ere
that month is out. I do not know if ever the
expeditionary force will come here, and I do not
know the policy which will be pursued; but there is
one thing I think I am justified in demanding, that
is the disbandment of these brutes, to whom only
yesterday I gave a gratuity of fifty dollars to erect
their breastwork&mdash;a totally unnecessary proceeding
on my part. Of course if I can hand over the
government to the Expeditionary Forces’ Leader
I have nothing to say; he can do as he likes. What
irritates me is, that a row like this is aided and
abetted by every officer, inasmuch as it is to me
the row is brought, they daring not to decide; of
course, it must be seen, that situated as we are, if
one corps can take rations for a month and eat
them in a fortnight, and then get more, it is virtually
giving double rations to the troops, for if you gave
to one part, all the rest would want it.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 20.</i>&mdash;A caravan of 300 men and twenty
camels came up the left bank of the White Nile,
from the direction of Metemma. 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> A soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
who came in from the Arabs, says, “The Mahdi
sent 2,000 men down towards Metemma on account
of the advance of the Expedition, who are near
Berber.” Also “reports the advance of King
Johannes” (which I doubt). I expect the caravan
seen to-day is a caravan with <i>the money</i> from Berber.
Report in the town says the Arabs have been repulsed
three times by the Expeditionary Force. The
Arabs are very quiet to-day; their Nordenfeldt kept
on grunting at intervals this morning. Four of those
precious troops the Shaggyeh (one a Bashi Bazouk),
have deserted to the Arabs; it was never reported
to me. I have a suspicion that more have gone.
We communicated with Omdurman Fort by flag-signals;
they are all right. The Arabs fired from
their guns on the White Nile, and from the Omdurman
side, a few rounds this evening.</p>

<p>It is rather astonishing to find that the row about
the rations the night before last, was made by the
Cairo Bashi Bazouks, who are completely at one’s
mercy, for the Arabs would never look at them;<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
they even went so far as to throw down their arms!
A volley of lies was told about this affair, trying to
prevent me hearing the truth. However, I got at
the bottom of it, and have noted my friends. A
merchant here had a partner in business, who went
to the Arabs eight months ago with £3,000 belonging
to this merchant, who coolly asks me to pay
the £3,000!!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 21.</i>&mdash;I do not believe one person has
died of hunger during the 8-11/30 months we have been
shut up. Ferratch Ullah Bey, in Omdurman, signalled,
“Yes, I have 230,000 rounds, but I fire a
lot every day.” Now this is a corker, for I do not
believe he fires ten rounds without my personal
knowledge, and I estimate his expenditure of ammunition
at under 2,000 rounds per diem. By this
I expect he wants me to open the road to him, and
ammunition is only an excuse; but I do not care to
risk a defeat, or a momentary success, attended
with a lot of wounded (we have sixty wounded in
hospital now).  To-day year came the news to
Kartoum of Hicks’ defeat. He left this on the 3rd
September.  The Greek Consul and the Greek
doctor describes the arrival of news thus at Kartoum:
At night came in the <i>Bordeen</i> with Coetlogon
from the White Nile. The Greek Consul was in
his house. Marquet, the French Consul, came to
his house and said, “Come to my house, by the
garden.”  He went to Marquet’s house; he found
Hussein Pasha Cheri, Ibrahim Pasha Haidar, Coetlogon,
Power, and Hansall. He was told “<i>Hicks is
finished</i>.” The Consul sent a telegram to Towfik,
“Hicks finished.” Then Towfik sent a telegram
that he would send up reinforcements that night.
Towfik had a large party at the Abdeen Palace, and
reports were rife that something bad was in the air,
but nobody knew anything. <i>Since that day no aid
has come to Soudan.</i> I hear that the day before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
yesterday two corporals (one who had come in from
the Arabs), five soldiers, and a clerk, all Soudan
soldiers, deserted to the Arabs. This was never
reported to me. I expect the officers have robbed
them.</p>

<p>Ferratch Ullah Bey, of Omdurman, signals he
has only 43,000 rounds left. This, out of 230,000
rounds, and I feel sure he tells fibs, and is acting in
order to force me to relieve him, which I shall not
attempt. He says he has had twenty-five wounded
and eleven killed. Church parades all round to-day.
The Arabs fired at Bourré and at Tuti this morning.</p>

<p>To-day I discovered a robbery of Ruckdi, my
old clerk, about which there could be no doubt
whatever, so I have turned him out, and written to
cancel his being made a Bey. A woman came in
from the Arabs. She says the Expedition left
Merowé for Berber, and that Mahomet Achmet will
try, on Monday, the 24th November, to take Omdurman
Fort. This is disagreeable news! However,
I have done what I can, and one can do no more
than trust now. What has been the painful position
for me is that there is not one person on whom I
can rely; also, there is not one person who considers
that he ought to do anything except his
routine duty. We have now been months blockaded,
and things are critical; yet not one of my subordinates,
except the chief clerk and his subordinate,
appears to-day. I had to send for them, and wait
till they came, perhaps an hour. “It is Friday, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
it is unreasonable to expect us at the office,” is what
they say. My patience is almost exhausted with
this continuous apparently never-ending trial; there
is not one department which I have not to superintend
as closely as if I was its direct head. The
officer who commanded the post from which the
men deserted never told me, but says he told Ferratch
Pasha. This Ferratch Pasha denies, and so it
goes on, tissues of lies, and they no more care about
being found out than not. It is indeed hopeless
work, and yet, truly, they have been treated most
handsomely in every way. Nearly every order,
except when it is for their interest, has to be repeated
two, and even three, times. I may truly say I am
weary of my life; day and night, night and day, it
is one continual worry.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Our breastworks at Tuti are bothering the Arabs
near Omdurman. A soldier came in from the Arabs;
he had nothing to say of importance. We have
got a breastwork also towards Goba, on the Isle of
Tuti. I have given those improvident troops 15,000
okes of biscuits. I sincerely hope I may never be
besieged with such a garrison another time. A slave
came in, and reports “that Berber has been taken
by the troops from Kassala, and that the Arab Governor
of Berber arrived at the Mahdi’s two days ago
(perhaps the caravan we saw yesterday);” also that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
“the four steamers have gone to Berber, <i>one being
disabled, or aground, or sunk</i>!” If this is the case,
it is that brute Nutzer Bey or Pasha who (keeping
himself well under cover) has disobeyed my repeated
orders as to “not taking the steamers against the
guns, but to stay quietly at Shendy and wait for the
Expedition.” The last order that I sent him was
that “I would cancel his appointment as Pasha if
he dared to disobey me again.” But of what avail
is that?</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 22.</i>&mdash;Slight firing at Bourré and Goba
this morning. A soldier deserted to the Arabs last
night, with his rifle.</p>

<p>A soldier and a slave came in from the Arabs.
It appears more Shaggyeh deserted to the Arabs
than the four I mentioned, but it seems perfectly
impossible to find out the truth, or even the number
of Shaggyeh there are.</p>

<p>I am terribly anxious for the fort at Omdurman,
and am trying to devise some means of occupying
the Arabs, and diverting their attention elsewhere.
Omdurman Fort signals they are all right; they had
another man wounded. Up to date we have had,
passing through the hospital, 242 wounded. We
have had some 1800 to 1900 killed (between 17th
March and 22nd November).</p>

<p>This is the present state of affairs; the Arab
camps are about five miles from the city.</p>

<p>Camp C is on river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-422.jpg" width="400" height="345"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>A is one mile from river; camp D and E are
three to four miles from the river. Of these
numbers perhaps there are 3000 to 4000 fighting
men, and 600 horsemen to 800 horsemen in the
<i>whole lot</i>. There is nothing like being precise in
these days, and it saves a deal of talking if one
knows a man’s ideas beforehand. If the Expedition
comes here before the place falls (which is doubtful),
and <i>if the instructions are to evacuate the place at
once, and leave Kassala and Sennaar, &amp;c., I will resign,
and have nothing more to do with the Government
of the place, or of the Soudan</i>; and this I have a perfect
right to do, and no one, not even the Soudan troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
or people, could say one word. It will depend on
circumstances how I shall act <i>in re</i> my commission
in Her Majesty’s service (which I do not hold too
fast to, seeing any future employment would not be
accepted, even if in the very improbable case of
its being offered); but I consider that every officer
has a right to resign, and if he resigns he is no
longer subject to military orders, and is free to go
when and where he likes. It may be argued I was
named Governor-General “in order to carry out
the evacuation of the Soudan, and that I am bound
to carry that out, which is quite correct, but I was
named for <span class="smcap">evacuation of Soudan</span>” (against which I
have nothing to say), <i>not to run away from Kartoum
and leave the garrisons elsewhere to their fate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> If
it is positively determined on <i>not to look after the
garrisons</i>, and <i>not</i> to <i>establish some sort of provisional
Government in the Soudan</i>, then the course
to pursue is <i>to name a Governor in my place on
day of arrival</i>, and carry out with that Governor that
policy which, I have already said, is one of very
great danger (putting all the <i>other</i> considerations
aside). <span class="smcap">Personally</span>, looking at the matter from a
<span class="smcap">very selfish point of view</span> (and seeing I have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
my best to prevent this policy being followed, and
am impatient to oppose it), I should be much
relieved at this <i>denouement</i>, for I should be in
Brussels on 20th January.</p>

<p>I have given 6,000 lbs. of biscuit out to the
poor (I expect half will be stolen), and I shall sell
to-morrow 90,000 lbs. to the townspeople. I am
determined if the town does fall, the Mahdi shall
find precious little to eat in it. Two soldiers got
hold of the head of a shell-rocket fired by Arabs,
and, having nothing better to do, they set to work
to open it. It burst, and has nearly killed one, and
wounded the other&mdash;the effects of curiosity!</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 23.</i>&mdash;A soldier came in at the North
Fort from the Arabs; he says the Expedition has
captured Berber, and are advancing on this, and the
Arabs want to attack Tuti Isle.</p>

<p>The Arabs, this morning, fired from Goba on
breastwork of Tuti. The soldier says my noble
friend, Nutzer Pasha, kept safely all the steamers
at Shendy, and never aided in any way at Berber.
The Arabs are (so says this soldier) collecting at
Halfeyeh to receive the expedition, but I do not
think it.</p>

<p>Three women came in last night from the Arabs to
North Fort; they had been captured during the raid
the Arabs made on the Shaggyeh some days ago.</p>

<p>The soldier who came in brought two rifles and
two belts of ammunition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferratch Ullah Bey, of Omdurman Fort, reports
“he is all right,” by signal.</p>

<p>A report has come in that the Expedition had
arrived at Metemma, and had encountered the
Arabs twice; that a steamer had been sent up to
inform me, but the Arab guns had forced her to
return; they say that this report has come into the
town by men who have friends in the Mahdi’s camp,
and who had seen some of the Arabs wounded.
This news is five days old. Very few Arabs in the
camp on the North of the Palace. The Shaggyeh
came and asked me to let them go up and pillage
the Arab camp as there were so few in it; they
knew well that I knew if I did give them leave they
would not go, so it was a safe volunteer on their
part. A caravan of Arabs came from the North to
the Arab camp this morning. The Arabs have only
one gun on the Omdurman side now; I expect the
rest are taken down against the Expedition. We
have only 541 rounds of Krupp ammunition left for
our two Krupps. I went to Mogrim, and practised
on the Arab House where their gun is, 1600 yards
range; we put three shells into it, upon which the
Arabs left. I am still apprehensive of an attack on
Omdurman Fort, and have the <i>Ismailia</i> steamer
ready. I have sent down thirty rockets (sky) to
Mogrim to be fired off; this will bother the Arabs,
who will not know what to make of it, and will
think we have got some very important <i>news</i>. I
know if this happened when <i>I</i> was meditating an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
assault, I should hesitate before I made that assault
after the fireworks.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 24</i>, 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;Arabs came down and fired
on the Isle of Tuti from Goba. Ferratch Ullah
Bey of Omdurman reports all well; another man had
been wounded, and one had died. A slave came in
from the Arabs on the south front, who says there is
no news of the Expedition in Walad a Goun’s camp.
12.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs near Omdurman Fort are retiring
from their position near the small steamer, and
are burning the straw huts; our men are firing on
them, and they do not reply, the <i>Husseinyeh</i> steamer
has slipped down towards deeper water, of herself.
I am sending down the <i>Ismailia</i> to reconnoitre. The
Arabs have not fired from their gun at Omdurman
to-day. It appears the <i>Husseinyeh</i> has sunk, so
that may be the reason of the Arabs retiring. I
expect the Mahdi wanted his troops, who were
guarding the steamer <i>Husseinyeh</i>, and so he sent off
men last night to sink her, and that is the history of
the retreat. It is somewhat of a relief to me, for I
expect it shows the Arabs will not make an assault
on Omdurman Fort. Perhaps our fireworks last
night all along the lines made the Mahdi think I
had some great news, which he did not know of;
we fired from five places fifteen sky-rockets at one
concerted moment. They report from Mogrim that
the Arabs retreated <i>before Husseinyeh</i> sank, but I
expect that is a fib, and that they did not leave till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
she sank; it is against all reason with a falling river,
and, fixed on a level as she was, she sank untouched.
The fact is, I expect, that the man put to watch her
was asleep, and the Arabs, trying to capture her,
drew her into deep water, when the water got into
her shot-hole. 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The <i>Ismailia</i> went down to
the junction of the Blue and White Niles, and the Arab
guns opened on her, so she has come back. I have
sent down to make inquiries on the quiet, whether
the Arabs returned <span class="smcap">before</span> or <span class="smcap">after</span> the sinking of
<i>Husseinyeh</i>. The Arabs fired five rounds at the
<i>Ismailia</i>. The Arabs came back to their breastwork
when the <i>Ismailia</i> appeared, but on her return
they also went back. If <i>Husseinyeh</i> had not had a
shot-hole in her, the Arabs would have captured her;
but, as I had taken her steam-cocks off, they could
not use her. We may be able to raise her if she has
sunk evenly. The steamer has sunk evenly, for her
funnel is above water.</p>

<p>I expect the Arabs put a slave-boy to turn the
handle of the Nordenfeldt, for it keeps on grunting all
day at intervals of half seconds, but does no harm.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 25.</i>&mdash;Arabs came to Goba this morning
and fired on the Isle of Tuti for half an hour. It is
quite true the <i>Arabs did work at the Husseinyeh and
caused her to sink, and on her sinking they retired</i>;
the sentries in our lines being all asleep, as I had
supposed. Ferratch Ullah Bey of Omdurman Fort
reports all well; he has another death among his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
wounded. I have promised him three days’ pay for
every day he and his men are shut up. 1.15 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
Steamers in sight; the doctor saw them first. The
steamers are firing; only one steamer in sight.</p>

<p>The Arabs had three guns at Halfeyeh against
the coming-in steamer. 2.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I have sent down
the <i>Ismailia</i> to cover the incoming steamer. The
Arabs are grunting with their Nordenfeldt, and
firing from their gun. Mogrim is playing on them
with the Krupp, and Tuti with their mountain gun.
2.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> For the last half-hour the firing on the part
of Arabs on the advancing steamer has been most
furious with guns and musketry; we replying. I
am grateful to say that, after this hot reception, she
has got in safe to Mogrim.</p>

<p>If any officer of the Expedition is on board, he
will know what it is to be in a penny boat! under
cannon fire. The <i>Bordeen</i> has come in; she has
seven wounded. There are <i>no Arabs</i> at Shoboloha,
or (consequently) <i>guns</i>; the wounded were from two
shells fired by the Arabs from Halfeyeh. The expeditionary
force is at Ambukol (which is <span class="smcap">lively</span>!);<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
the Arabs had four guns at Halfeyeh; one woman
was killed in the <i>Bordeen</i>: the letters received by
<i>Bordeen</i> are of no great import, for they do not tell
me the route the expedition will take, and I have
received a later post&mdash;that of 14th October.</p>

<p>Two men were wounded at Mogrim to-day. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to the report of the two men who came from
Dongola, it is not <i>certain</i> that the <i>Abbas</i> is captured.</p>

<p>I enclose a telegram,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which we cannot decipher.
I imagine Colonel Stewart has the key, it being
probably Foreign Office cipher.</p>

<p>Towfik, by a telegram, cancels his Firman, which
gives up the Soudan,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> which I have <i>torn up</i>, but
enclose; (this telegram<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> I received to-day).</p>

<p>A telegram to the Ulemas from Towfik says:
<i>“Baring” is coming up with Lord Wolseley</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;One man came to Goba and fired
two shots and retired. The Arabs fired three rounds
at Fort Omdurman. The Fort reports all right.
Nutzi Pasha reports that the money at Berber has
been taken up to the Mahdi. He sends up four
wounded. He says the Expedition is advancing in
three parties&mdash;one to Berber from Ambukol, one
from Ambukol to Metemma, and one from Ambukol
to Shoboloha. This letter was written six days ago.
A caravan came across from the north to the
Mahdi’s camp to-day. The Arabs at Metemma have
crossed to Shendy and gone into the interior. Four
fellaheen soldiers deserted from Nutzi Pasha and
went to the Arabs&mdash;I expect through his ill-treatment
of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three long telegrams in cipher, which
I cannot make out, pasted on the other side.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>I had a letter saying Government had given
Kitchener <i>carte blanche</i> to pay the Mahdi up to
£20,000 for me; but adds the “writer does not
think I would accept such a proposition”; in which
he is quite right; neither would the Mahdi.</p>

<p>I like Baker’s description of Kitchener.</p>

<p>“The man whom I have always placed my hopes
upon, Major Kitchener, R.E., who is one of the few
<i>very superior</i> British officers, with a cool and good
head and a hard constitution, combined with untiring
energy, has now pushed up to Dongola and has
proved that the Mudir is dependable. The latter
has given him a letter received from you asking
about reinforcements, and stating that you have
8000 troops at Kartoum, and that Sennaar is still
occupied by the Government forces.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>There was a slight laugh when Kartoum heard
Baring was bumping<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> his way up here, for so we
read Towfik’s telegram&mdash;a regular Nemesis.</p>

<p>I am sure we are deprived of a treat in not being
able to decipher the long telegrams on the preceding
page. It also is delicious to find not one civil word
from any official personage except Kitchener; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
relieves me immensely (also I must except Towfik,
who in his dispatch was civil and polite). Evidently
I am in disgrace! How fearful!</p>

<p>According to the man who came yesterday the
<i>Abbas</i> struck a rock, and the two boats surrendered
to the Arabs. I have no doubt but that the Arabs
have captured the steamer <i>Abbas</i>, for the Arab
chief of Berber sent to Cassim el Mousse an impression
of the seal I used when I was up here
before, and which I sent down by Stewart. Now, it
is impossible he could have known this unless he
had possession of the seal, for I do not think Stewart
knew it. The Arabs at Omdurman have the slave
boy grinding away at their Nordenfeldt. I have
sent one of our French mitrailleuses down to
grind on them. If Baring does bump his way up
here as British Commissioner, I shall consider he
has expiated his faults and shall forgive him.
We seldom realise our position. In ten or twelve
years’ time Baring, Lord Wolseley, myself, Evelyn
Wood, &amp;c., will have no teeth, and will be deaf;
some of us will be quite <i>passé</i>; no one will come
and court us; new Barings, new Lord Wolseleys
will have arisen, who will call us “bloaks” and
“twaddlers.” “Oh! for goodness’ sake come away,
then! Is that dreadful bore coming? If once he
gets alongside you, you are in for half an hour,” will
be the remark of some young captain of the present
time on seeing you enter the Club. This is very
humiliating, for we, each one, think we are immortal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
That poor old General ... who for years vegetated
at the end of &mdash;&mdash; street close to Clubs! who
ever visited him? Better a ball in the brain than to
flicker out unheeded, like he did.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 26.</i>&mdash;The ex-Khedive will chuckle over
Baring’s ride to the Soudan. I can fancy him twinkling
his little eyes over it. He came up in his youth
to Dongola with his uncle Ismail Pasha, a slim
youth; Halim (the rightful heir to the Khediviat
after Ismail) also was here as Governor-General for
three weeks, but he bolted back, without leave,
from Said Pasha, who was then Viceroy. If Ismail,
ex-Khedive, could only get Malet, Vivian, and
Colvin to go this ride, I think he would forgive
his deposition. I have published the telegram of
Towfik to me, and to the Notables (note that in this
telegram, Towfik&mdash;a year late, it is true&mdash;says he is
sorry for Hicks’s army destruction!), saying he will
retain the Soudan. Whoever comes up here had
better appoint Major Kitchener Governor-General,
for it is certain, after what has passed, <i>I am impossible</i>.
(What a comfort!)</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 27.</i>&mdash;The Arabs fired with artillery and
musketry on Bourré for about an hour this morning.
They fired three shells, at Omdurman Fort, who
signals it is all right.</p>

<p>Two slaves came in to-day; they say the Arabs
are wanting in ammunition. I do not wonder at it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
at the way they fire it away; they say the Mahdi
has had a revelation that the Turks will keep the
country for eight years, that he is to go back and
come again at the end of the eight years.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The little
captured steamer <i>Mahomet Ali</i> came down near
Giraffe last night, and then went back.</p>

<p>If Kitchener would take the place, he would be
the best man to put in as Governor-General, but I
must confess I think, <i>with our Government constituted
as it is</i>, that for Her Majesty’s Government to
take the charge of these countries would be a very
serious burden, and that the only solution would be
the Sultan taking them over, with a subsidy and
the ports of Suakin and Massowah. Judging from
Towfik’s telegram to me, it would seem that the
Hewitt Treaty has fallen through, for he speaks of
the retention of Kassala.</p>

<p>Our Government has two courses to pursue, <i>one</i>
to appoint Kitchener or some other Governor-General,
and to be prepared to give him £500,000
a year for two years, for he will never get any taxes
worth speaking of; for two years, also, our Government
must be prepared to renew the stores, war
material, &amp;c., and give 6000 extra soldiers to the
Soudan. Second, to give the country over to the
Sultan with two millions and the ports.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>To me the last is the best and speediest course to
pursue; it rids Her Majesty’s Government for ever
of any responsibility. If the first course was taken,
to my mind, a <i>sine quâ non</i> for its success would be,
<i>to make up with France in re Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>There is one other course, an intermediate one,
viz., Zubair, with £100,000 a year, and replenished
magazines.</p>

<p>About forty females congregated under my window,
yelling for food. It delights me to think of the treat
Baring will have when he gets here (if ever he does).
I do not think there are 500 Arabs in the camp on
north side, and no horsemen, though their straw huts
extend further than they did in the first blockade.
The <i>Zubair</i> steamer was launched to-day. With
respect to the force of Arabs on north side it may
be said, “if so few, why not attack them;” but supposing
I was wrong, and they were more than I
think, a defeat would cause the fall of the town,
therefore I will not risk it.</p>

<p>The Ulemas and Notables got a telegram from
Towfik excusing himself for his indolence. They
came to-day and wished to send an answer, which
I agreed to. They did this of their free will, and
<span class="smcap">not prompted much by me</span>. It will make Towfik
hop. Of the Ulemas who came, <i>two</i> (the Sheikh
el Islam and the Cadi) had been imprisoned by
me.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 28.</i>&mdash;Fort Omdurman all right. Another
of the wounded has died. Two soldiers came in
from the Arabs. Small church parades, that on the
Blue Nile rather larger than usual. We have to-day
in store 174,400 okes of biscuit and 1165 ardebs of
dhoora, which is not bad after 261 days’ blockade.
A slave has come in at the North Fort, and says the
Arabs are expecting four steamers to come up. I
hope that the officer in command will clear Halfeyeh
before he pushes on to this, for he may get a shell
from the Arabs at Omdurman into one of his steamers.
I do not like to risk the <i>Bordeen</i> down by herself
to give this warning. If the steamers do come up,
and have not the sense to stop at Halfeyeh, I shall
endeavour to warn them by a tremendous fire on the
Arabs at Omdurman. The danger is at the Ras, or
nose (<span class="smcap">x</span>), on the junction of the rivers.
We are protecting the <i>Bordeen</i> by
casing her steam-chest with wood.
The proper thing to do would be to
clear the Halfeyeh camp of the Arabs
before coming on here. You could
then communicate with Kartoum by land, and avoid
having to run in penny steamboats the gauntlet of
Arab guns.</p>

<p>A woman came in from the Arabs. She says
yesterday morning a man came to the Arab camp
on the north side who said that the Expedition had
captured Berber, and that four steamers were on
their way here; that the Arabs sent out men to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
see if this was true, and that it is my own soldiers
who are now fighting against us.</p>

<p>If the news that Berber is captured is true,
the steamers will be towing up boats (fifty of which
are at Berber) and will not be here for some days.
2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I think the Arabs are making an embrasure
at Goba, with the view of bombarding the Palace.
I can see this with my glass.
If they do this, it will not hurt
us, and it will take their men and guns from off
the river, where their gun-fire is alone dangerous
to the steamers. It is rather amusing to see the
<i>personality</i><a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> of this Arab battery. The range is 2,200
yards from here, but as <i>we</i> never hit anything we
fire at, at that distance, I think I shall be safe in the
Palace from the Arab fire. The mountain shell will
not penetrate the walls at that distance, as we know
from a shell which struck the North Fort some time
ago. I expect they will begin to-morrow morning
at daybreak. I have fired eight or ten rounds at
them; which brought them out to look, but it is quite
a chance if the Remington reaches them at that
range. There was a time when one would have
been anxious for the Palace, but that has gone by.
It will not be the first time I have been fired on by
my own soldiers, for in China two men of the 31st
Regiment were on the breach of Taitsan and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
was killed. The other with a shell splinter, was
taken prisoner. “Mr. Gordon! Mr. Gordon, you
will not let me be killed.” “Take him down to the
river and shoot him;” and <i>aside</i>, “put him in my
boat: let the doctor attend him, and send him to
Shanghai.” He was sent down to Shanghai, and
got three or six months’ imprisonment by court-martial
for deserting, and I daresay he exists at
present. His name was Hargreaves. I do not
know his regimental number.</p>

<p>Baring to Egerton&mdash;“Metemma! at last, after
the most fearful sufferings, every bone in my body
dislocated with those beastly camels. Found here
his journal, from which it appears that that duffer,
the Mahdi, has at last roused himself, but I fear
it is too late. As to the tone of the journal, it is
<i>simply deplorable</i>, and (do not mention it, please) he
has actually made a sketch (brace yourself up to
bear it) of our high priest. Excuse more, for what
with the bumping of the camel and the depravity
shown by this scoffer, I am more dead than alive.”
A Bashi Bazouk (no loss), a bugler, and two
musicians (of our terrible band) deserted to Arabs
yesterday, as ... says it is “incorrigible.” This is
owing to the robbery of the rations by the officers.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 29.</i>&mdash;Omdurman Fort all right, but three
men deserted to the Arabs. Truly this life is almost
insupportable: the officers have been robbing the
men of their rations, and the storekeeper has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
giving them short weight. One feels utterly powerless
to contend with these affairs, and unless the Expedition
comes soon the place will fall from the venality
of these people.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> They know I cannot possibly find
out their misdeeds, and chuckle over it. The Arabs
are working away at their battery at Goba.</p>

<p>It is odd that among the despised Egyptian
fellaheen soldiers this robbery of rations does not
take place. It is only among the officers, &amp;c., of
the black troops. 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I hear that the soldiers
waylay the women, to whom I have given biscuit,
and rob them!</p>

<p>I have a strong conviction that neither Baring or
Lord W. have taken the precaution of bringing a
firman from Towfik Pasha, giving them a legal status
superior to mine in the Soudan. If this conviction
is the case (and the fiction of Towfik being supreme
ruler is kept up), then it is for me to name the
Governor-General, and I feel strongly disposed to
print off proclamations to be issued on arrival of
Expedition (if ever it does arrive), by which I relinquish
the government in favour of the officer commanding
the Expedition. Of course, if a firman is
brought, then the situation is different; but <i>if not
brought</i>, and the <i>fiction is going to be kept up</i>, I have
a perfect right to vacate the government, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
appoint whomsoever I like, subject to the ultimate
approval of Towfik Pasha. It may be that the
officer commanding the Expedition may demur to
his appointment, but his doing so will not absolve
him of the responsibility thus officially placed on
him if the town falls.</p>

<p>The great question, “Is any officer, civil or military,
of the Expedition possessed of a firman of Towfik?”
If not, there is not the least doubt that the <i>de jure</i>
power is with me to name whom I like (except in
the case of a civil or military officer announcing to the
people that the British Government has annexed
Egypt). There can be no question of military discipline
in this, for what has a foreign Power to do
with the civil functionaries of Towfik, unless they
usurp his (Towfik’s) functions?</p>

<p>Two more soldiers deserted to-day. 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The
Arabs came down to the ruins of village opposite,
and fired on the Palace. I sent the buglers up to the
roof of the Palace, who by their own accounts killed
thousands, and the Arabs retired. I have got so
accustomed to the sound of the firing, that I can tell
when the report of firing is <i>from Arabs on Tuti or
Palace</i>, or our men <i>from Tuti</i> or <i>North Fort</i>. Also
if it is the Arabs firing on Mogrim or Bourré, or our
men firing on them, from these places. According
to the directions of the muzzles of the rifles, so are
the sounds. I think I would like to be in a real
siege, with no civil population or robbers of officers
to bully me. To-night a sortie with fifty men would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
give the Arabs a dose which they would not forget;
but it is no use, we are not up to it. The buglers
say they killed thirty (!!!) between them.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>November 30.</i>&mdash;Fort Omdurman all right. A
slave came from the Arabs to it last night. Arabs
(10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>) have fired two rounds from their
(“personality”)<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> battery at Goba, but the projectiles
did not reach the Palace.</p>

<p>I hear that one of the shells fired by Arabs did
reach the town, and fell behind the Palace. They
have fired three rounds more, and then the house in
which they had their gun fell down. They are now
digging away to get out the gun. I expect the gun-carriage
requires repair, for the house was a good
height. 11.15 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Arabs either had another gun
besides that in the house which fell down, or that
gun was not damaged in the fall of house, for they
have just fired another round at the North Fort.
Noon. The Arabs fired three more rounds at the
North Fort. The shells burst in the air, and the
Arabs have now gone to dinner. Another man
deserted to the Arabs; he had previously deserted
from the Arabs to us. Two of the band reported
to have deserted to the Arabs have been found in
the town. The Arabs at Goba (whom I do not
think number more than 40!!!) fired three more
rounds from their gun this evening. I feel strongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
disposed to go over <i>myself</i> with 100 men (<i>against</i>
40!) and attack them to-morrow. It is simply
ridiculous the apathy that is shown. These forty
men, which is the outside of their number, are at
least four miles from any assistance. The place
is so flat and bare that this is a certainty.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 1.</i>&mdash;During the night the Arabs fired on
town with their guns. At daybreak they fired from
their guns on the Palace and the North Fort, and
on Mogrim and Bourré. A caravan of seventeen
camels came to the Mahdi from Dongola to-day.
The “Nordenfeldt” (Omdurman) has been silent
for last three days. Omdurman Fort all right.
10.40 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Arabs just fired one shot, which struck
water in front of the Palace; they fired another
which burst in the air.</p>

<p>11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I have sent down the <i>Bordeen</i> to entice
the Arabs to waste their ammunition, which they are
doing.</p>

<p>Towfik’s telegram to me, was to-day more fully
explained, and I gather that he says Lord Wolseley
and Sir E. Baring are coming up, and that they will
settle the question of the Soudan. I have replied,
that it may be convenient for him (Towfik), but it does
not meet the case, unless these two officials have a
firman from him, giving them authority. Now this
the two officials will never have, for it virtually
would make them <i>Towfik’s subordinates</i>. It is
implied in the telegram, that I am to arrange with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
these two officials, as to the Soudan. A delightful
arrangement for Towfik, but not one so delightful
for me; so I have answered him, <i>it is for him</i>
(Towfik) <i>to arrange with these two officials, and to
send his arrangements in the form of a firman here</i>.
It is certain that no legal authority exists in the
Soudan, except it is held from Towfik, and unless
these two officials have authority from Towfik, they
have no authority in the Soudan; now if they hold
authority from Towfik, they are under Towfik’s
orders.</p>

<p>The “fiction” will not hold good in the Soudan.
Though I am pretty well dispirited for the last few
days, I cannot help laughing at the fearful mess we
are in. Towfik is as sharp as his father, and wants
to quietly saddle me with the controversy, reserving
to himself the right of criticism, but I do not feel
inclined to be thus saddled, and I shall perhaps
appoint Baring Governor-General, subject to the
approval of Towfik, and shall bolt. B. may say
he will not take it, but he will have no choice, for, if
he does not, he throws away any legal status he
possesses. He, on his part, may name some one
else, but that will be his look out. My object, of
course, is to make tracks, if I can do so (without
hurting our country, or being the cause of danger in
the smallest degree to our troops), and to leave the
onus on Baring and the Ministry. I do not feel
so kindly to Towfik as to fight his battles up here,
which is what he evidently aims at, neither do I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
inclined to compromise myself by aiding Baring.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> I
have said the only possible solution is the Sultan, let
the subsidy be what it may. The fact is that the
expeditionary force comes up here as allies of
Towfik (unless its Government says it comes up
as independent), and as allies of Towfik, it is
in all reason subject, as far as civil affairs are
concerned, to Towfik; its officers can issue no
decrees, except <i>in his name</i>, save those which
concern military operations. A nice accommodating
Governor-General would work this affair, without
friction. <i>I will not</i>, for I am too deeply involved
with the people; but I want (like a rat) to
leave the house before it falls, so the best thing
is to hint to me, “make Kitchener Governor-General,”
“<i>subject to the approval of Towfik</i>!” Then
K. would do all you want, and in a legal way, and
you would be happy. Unless you have a superior
firman to mine, you cannot make K. Governor-General
(even if you had ten million troops), unless
you declare yourself the rulers of the land, which
you will not do, because of the ninety millions
sterling of debt on Egypt. 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Arabs fired two
more shells at the Palace, so I put the three
buglers on the roof to practice at them. <i>They say</i>
they killed fifteen. I would much like to know contents
of Lord W.’s telegram to me, also the telegrams
in cipher from Nubar and Baring; but I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
shall have that pleasure, for I do not expect either
this journal will ever be given back, or if it is, that
I shall be lent the cipher books to decipher them.
The Arabs fired two rounds at the Palace this
evening, one fell in the water in front of the Palace,
and one fell in the garden. Two shells fired by
the Arabs from Bourré to-day, fell close to the
hospital.</p>

<p>To my mind, this is the idea of H.M. Government:&mdash;<i>Expedition
comes up to look after British
subjects nominally</i>, but, <i>in reality, to settle future
government of Soudan, under the pretence that
Towfik governs</i>. Towfik telegraphs to me, “that
the British officials will settle future status of the
Soudan with me <i>sub rosa</i>”!! now, of course, I may
be wrong, but my idea is that the British officials
will propose <i>the keeping of Sennaar, Kartoum,
Berber, and Dongola</i>, the <i>non-interference with the
Mahdi, cession of Kassala to King John, the leaving
to their fate the Equator Provinces, &amp;c.</i> And what
the British officials propose Towfik will agree to; but
then comes the question, as <i>I</i> consider <i>the proposal
is unacceptable</i> (inasmuch as long as the Mahdi is
alongside, no peace is possible), I will not accept
it, and will leave A. or B. as my, and Towfik’s representative,
to carry the proposition out. (“<i>Après moi,
le déluge.</i>”) No one can blame me for this, for I
should be a scoundrel if I accepted any proposition
which would eventually give trouble to our
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 2.</i>&mdash;The Arabs fired four shells at the
Palace at daybreak with no effect. 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> They have
fired four more; one burst close to my room&mdash;a little
high. I have put two guns near the Palace to
reply to them. Report in town says Waled a
Goun’s men are passing over from the right bank
of the White Nile to the Mahdi’s camp on the left
bank. Omdurman Fort reports all right. 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
The Arabs opened fire again on the Palace; we
are answering. The Arabs have now two guns
firing on us. There is a report that the Arabs
of the Mahdi are going north (on the left bank of
the White Nile). Noon.&mdash;We have silenced our
friends opposite, having concentrated a heavy fire
on them. I nearly lost my eyes this morning, firing
on Arabs, the base of the brass cartridge blew out,
and sent the fire into my face; this is a fault of the
Remington; the metal case of this cartridge must
not be used too often.</p>

<p>Some people ought to have their heads cut off,
if there is to be any quiet in the Soudan; I wonder
how our Government will be able to allow this to
be done under their nose, for however necessary to
cut their heads off, looking to future peace of the
Soudan, they can scarcely be called rebels, for they
may say they were forced into rebellion by the
inability of the Government aiding them, and also
that they had heard that the Soudan was abandoned.
3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> <i>Another battle!</i> with Arabs at Goba, who,
however, have no guns&mdash;firing terrific. 3.15 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span><span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
Battle is over, and we have won. Arabs silent.
3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Arabs began it again, by firing their gun.
3.38 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Battle over, an Arab (or most likely one of
my men) is standing up, throwing dust in the air
(like as Shimei dusting David&mdash;“Thou bloody
man.” 2 Samuel xvi. 8). The Arabs must have
used up a lot of ammunition, for they kept up a
good fire, though where their bullets went no one
could see; the Palace and the North Fort and
Muduriat being high, our bullets reach them, but
theirs do not appear to reach the river. They have
a regular casemate for the two guns, one directed
on the Palace and one on the North Fort. They
took two days to make it, quite a creditable piece of
work, with a screen wall in front. In the Crimea
it was supposed and considered mean to bob, and
one used to try and avoid it.... used to say,
“It is all well enough for you, but I am a family
man,” and he used to bob at every report. For my
part, I think judicious bobbing is not a fault, for I
remember seeing on two occasions shells like this
“●” before my eyes, which certainly, had I not
bobbed, would have taken off my head (“<i>And a
good riddance too!</i>” F. O. would say). I make
these remarks with reference to the Arab rifle fire;
you can see them with the telescope aim directly at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
this wing of the Palace and fire, and then one hears
a thud in the water; I have got quite accustomed
to them now. The mitrailleuse (a Gatling) moved
them out of their cover this evening; we have it on
the Muduriat. The Palace roof is thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-477.jpg" width="250" height="116"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p class="pn">a shell striking <i>x</i> would bring down the roof, so
when the Arabs fire, one does not feel comfortable
as one hears the shell sighing through the air, till
one hears it fall; it is at least 40 feet in height, but
with only two storeys. The pasha who built it
(Momtoz Pasha) built it without leave from the old
Khedive, taking funds which he had no right to;
the old Khedive did not see it, and Ismail Pasha
Ayoub, who was a prisoner here, split on him; he
was tried here, and they say was poisoned, Ismail
Ayoub getting his place. Ismail Ayoub was sent
up because he did not treat one of the cast-off wives
of the old Khedive (whom he was forced to marry)
with proper respect; so this wife got up a harem
intrigue, and he was exiled.</p>

<p>He (Ismail Ayoub) was a great scamp, whatever
was the cause of his exile. He belonged to Kurdistan,
and was originally a bugler in Said Pasha’s
band; and I used to tell him, he was as much a
foreigner in this land as I was. He was a good
musician, and had learnt French and German. He
is now dead. Whilst I was here, I think he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the best administrator the Soudan ever had. He
was the Minister of the Interior during Lord
Dufferin’s time, and wrote the famous despatch
about the inutility of using the kourbatch. <i>He!</i>
who was famous for its use up here, and who,
with Cherif and Towfik, roared with laughter over
the affair, for Lord Dufferin in the gravest way
reported it to Lord Granville, who, I dare say,
laughed as heartily over it with Mr. Sanderson.
Poor Ismail Ayoub! he was a most agreeable
scoundrel; but he came to grief at Cairo in 1883 as
Minister of Finance. The bugler “<i>Almas</i>” (<i>i.e.</i>
the <i>diamond</i>) telegraphed his <i>confrères</i> that he had
killed twenty Arabs to-day!!</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 3.</i>&mdash;This morning Arabs fired eight
rounds at us, and we replied; one of our shells
struck their casemate. Numbers of Arabs left
Mahdi’s camp for the north. Arabs fired nine
rounds into the town at night from the south lines.
One shell fell into the garden of the Palace; this
from the south lines. A shell from Arabs at Goba
fell in the garden, so it will be seen the attention
which is being paid to the Palace.</p>

<p>Twenty shells fell in town yesterday, but none
did any harm.</p>

<p>I think this is the programme, and though it is
of doubtful morality, perhaps it is the shortest route
out of a mess. “British Expedition comes up to
relieve British subjects in distress, <i>nothing else</i>; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
finds one of its subjects acting as ruler; it takes
him away, and he, on going away, appoints Zubair
ruler, subject to approval of Towfik, Zubair having
been allowed to come up to Kartoum, as a private
individual, to look after his family.”</p>

<p>Now who can say anything to the British Government?
It has had nothing to do with the appointment
of Zubair, or with the Government of Towfik;
it came up to relieve its subjects, and “Gordon is
entirely responsible for the appointment of Zubair;”
“even Towfik is not responsible, for Gordon did it
on his own responsibility.” This will be a splendid
dodge; it first clears Her Majesty’s Government of
any blame, it puts the blame on me, and in the storm
that is caused, I shall have been so effectually
blackened that every one will forget the&mdash;well! we
will not say it in direct words (count the months),
we will call the <span class="smcap">Delay</span>; in fact, I expect the public
will rather blame the Government for having sent
any Expedition at all for such a style of British
subject; the Government will chuckle over it all,
and will preserve the <i>fiction</i> that they have nought
to do with the Soudan or Egypt.</p>

<p>The Opposition will be perfectly wild at seeing the
Ministry get out of the mess, with what one may
call really credit, while the Anti-Slavery Society and
Europe at large will empty their vials of wrath on
me. Towfik and his pashas will wring their hands
<i>openly</i> over such an act ... will get such kudos!
For my part I shall get out of any of those wretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
honours, for the Ministry will be only too glad to
say, “We could not, you know, confer any honours
on him after such very disreputable conduct,” knowing
well enough I would not take them if offered;
and as I am not going to England again, and shall
not see the papers, I shall not much mind the abuse.
I think it is a splendid programme. Zubair must be
given either £200,000 or £300,000 a year for two
years, replenished magazines, and stores of all sorts,
all the Expedition’s boats and steamers, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and must be aided for two months in small expeditions;
besides the £200,000 or £300,000 for two
years, he must have down on the nail £150,000 to
£200,000.</p>

<p>I must clear, in disgrace, out of the country, to
prevent any appearance of any connivance on the
part of ... in this arrangement, which he will or
ought officially to deplore. I do not think Zubair
will care for the Equator Province; he will agree
to give that up; he will agree to uphold the Treaty
of 1877 Slave Convention, and laugh as he does so.
As for the Bahr Gazelle, I expect the Mahdi has it,
and if so, his people will move up there, when Zubair
by his politics recaptures Obeyed.</p>

<p>What a fearful row there will be. I know one
man who will write: “Better, my dear Gordon, <span class="smcap">far</span>
better! to have died, than have so very far departed
from the right path; nothing, no nothing can
explain it away. A happy Christmas to you.”
... “This news from the Soudan is very satisfactory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
I call it a great triumph, for it not only
delivers us out of a dilemma, but it effectually settles
our friends, and vitiates anything he<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> may say as to
the Delay.” Any military operations undertaken
after the proclamation of Zubair will be put down
“as measures necessary to be undertaken to secure
the return, unmolested, of the expeditionary force.”
5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Artillery duel going on between our two guns
and the Arab gun; our practice is very bad. The
shells the Arabs fire from their Krupp gun reach
the Palace Garden, but the report of their gun is
not to be heard. The Arab shells from Goba fall
just about 200 yards short of the Palace; but in its
line there is just the second of suspense (after seeing
them fire), while one hears the soft sighing of their
shells coming nearer and nearer, till they strike.
7 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> <i>Another battle!</i> (the third to-day). The
Arabs came down to the river and fired on the
Palace; we could not stand <i>that</i>. 7.10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Battle
over; we are as we were, minus some cartridges.
7.20 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Battle begun again, because the buglers
played “Salaam Effendina,” the Arabs wasting
ammunition. 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs are firing from
the south at the Krupps on the Palace; they (<i>i.e.</i>
the Arabs) are at least 4000 yards distant; one
hears the shells burst, but not the report of their
gun; they reached the river close to the Palace.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 4.</i>&mdash;Omdurman Fort all right. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
had a man wounded yesterday. There was a small
battle at Bourré this morning. The Arabs at Goba
are quiet after the exertions of yesterday. Firing
was heard (on north) towards Shoboloha last night.
Report in town says the steamers are near there.</p>

<p>Should the Zubair arrangement be accepted, then
comes the question of the military action during two
months, at end of which time the expeditionary
force should be wending its way back. The driving
away of the Arabs from the Dem at the north of the
Palace will be immediate on the arrival of the
troops; the Arabs will then hold on to El foun
and to Giraffe. They will vacate the vicinity of
Omdurman Fort; 1000 men will deal with El foun
and Giraffe, supported by our tag-rag. First Giraffe,
then El foun; but at the same time as this takes
place, the retreat of Arabs ought to be cut off at
Gitana from Kordofan by the steamers and another
1000 men; the Mahdi will return to Schatt, and
the town will be free, and all the troops defending
the lines will be available. Then comes the question
of going inland and attacking the family of the
Sheikh el Obeyed’s son, two and a half hours
inland, or else going on and attacking Mesalamieh.
I think Sheikh el Obeyed’s family will give in as
soon as the Arabs are driven from El foun (an
affair of an hour, <i>D. V.</i>). I tried to entice the Arabs
at Goba into a fight this evening, but they would
not be drawn, and only replied by two shells, which
fell in the river.  We played on them with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
mitrailleuse, and made them move their gun, and
then they fired two more shells, one which fell near
the Palace in the river. With a good mitrailleuse,
and a sharp operator, <i>with telescope sight</i>, no gun
could be served with impunity at 2000 yards range,
though it could be served <i>against artillery fire</i>, for
at that range there is plenty of time to dodge under
cover after seeing the flash ere the shell arrives.
The band, principally of small boys, the men being
on the lines, went on to the roof of the Palace to
play (they always come on the eve of their Sabbath,
the Friday). The Arabs heard them, and fired
a volley at them; they, furious, threw down their
instruments, and flew to arms, and a regular fusillade
went on for some moments, the other places supporting
the fire. The buglers are bugling now
“Come to us, come to us,” to the Arabs. (The
Egyptian Government have the French calls, and
can converse by bugle; I do not think we have.)
Last night a <i>renegade</i> Dervish bugler in the Arab
ranks replied, “Come to us, come to us.”</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;Small church parades. Three caravans
of some size came in from the north to
Mahomet Achmet’s camp this morning. Two
deserters came in from the Arabs. Fort at Omdurman
all right. In store 737 ardebs of dhoora,
121,300 okes of biscuit.</p>

<p>We are going to make an attempt to relieve
Omdurman Fort (really things are looking very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
black). The men who came in say the Mahdi is
short of ammunition. The Arabs fired three shells
at the palace this afternoon, which fell in the river.
A soldier deserted to-day to the Arabs. 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The
Arabs fired two shells at the palace, which fell into
the water (if <i>they only</i> knew! that if they sank the
trail they would touch us up! their line is quite correct).
6.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Since 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we have been firing
on them, and they on us, only wasting ammunition,
for though our bullets reach them, few of theirs reach
us. According to the men who came in from the
Arabs, it is the pet detachment of the Mahdi who
are opposite the Palace; they do not number more
than one hundred, and are principally our Soudan
soldiers. I have almost given up all idea of saving
the town; it is a last resource, this attempt we make
to open the route to the Omdurman Fort.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 6.</i>&mdash;(Certainly every fortified place ought
to be provided with a hundred good telescopes.)
The steamers went down and fired on the Arabs
at Omdurman. We have £150 in cash in the
treasury. In the affair to-day we had three killed
and thirty-six wounded in the steamers, and Ferratch
Ullah Bey reports he had five wounded at Omdurman
Fort. The Arabs came down in good force,
and must have lost.</p>

<p>I have given up all idea of landing at Omdurman;
we have not the force to do it. The Arabs fired
forty-five rounds from their guns at Mogrim and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
steamers. We had two men wounded at Mogrim,
and one killed. This is most distressing to have
these poor fellows wounded and killed. To-morrow
it will be 270 days 9 months that we have endured
one continuous misery and anxiety. The Greeks who
were at Mogrim say at least 300 or 400 Arabs were
killed and wounded in to-day’s engagement. The
<i>Ismailia</i> was struck by four, and the <i>Bordeen</i> by two
shells, but not in vital parts. I visited the steamers,
and had weariness of heart at hearing the complaint
of the men as to the robbery of their rations by the
officers.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 7.</i>&mdash;The 270th day of our imprisonment.
The Arabs fired from their guns at Goba 8 shells,
one of which fell in the town near Palace, but did no
harm. Omdurman reports the fort all right, one
more man wounded there. A great force of Arabs
strayed down near Omdurman last night, and left at
dawn. The cock turkey has killed one of his companions,
reason not known. (Supposed to be correspondence
with Mahdi, or some harem infidelity.)
Report in town that Berber surrendered, “<i>sans coup
férir</i>.” I hope so. We are going to send the
steamers down again to attack the Arabs at Omdurman
at noon to-morrow. The Arabs fired nine
shells at Bourré, and begun again their practice on
the Palace, firing five shells, one of which came close
to the roof of Palace.</p>

<p>A soldier escaped from the Arabs and came in; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
says the Expeditionary Force has captured Berber.
Two soldiers deserted to the Arabs to-day! The
Arabs at Goba fired three shells this evening at the
Palace; two fell close to it, one fell in the water.
One shell from the Arabs at Bourré fell in the
hospital. One of the shells of the Arabs this evening
struck the building next the Palace, and stuck in the
wall, about 9 feet from the ground. A man came in
from the Arabs, who says the Expeditionary Force
is approaching. I saw a body of horsemen going
north to-day, very fast, from El foun. In the
<i>Ismailia</i> were eighty bullet holes on the water line
of her hull; in the <i>Bordeen</i> there were seventy-five
bullet holes, ditto <i>in the last engagement</i>!!! These
holes were stopped by screws made for the purpose.
As for the bullet marks elsewhere they are not to
be counted.</p>

<p>My belief is that the Mahdi business will be the
end of slavery in the Soudan. The Arabs have
invariably put their slaves in the front and armed
them; and the slaves have seen that they were
plucky, while their masters shirked: is it likely that
those slaves will ever yield obedience to those
masters as heretofore?</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 8.</i>&mdash;The Arabs this morning fired twelve
rounds from guns at Bourré, and five rounds at the
North Fort and Palace. Two men came in from the
Arabs; they say no Arabs have gone down towards
Berber; that the report in the Arab camp was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
that Berber was captured; this report was four days
old. 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The steamers are going down to attack.
Omdurman Fort reports “<i>All right</i>” 10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
The steamers are engaged; the Arabs have two
nasty wasp batteries with regular embrasures, quite <i>à
l’Europe</i>. (Query Slatin Bey’s design.) Though we
have protected the steam-chests of the steamers, one
cannot help being very anxious. The Arabs at Goba
are <i>silent</i>. Another soldier from the Arabs came
in and states report of advance of the Expeditionary
Force, who are coming by land. Every time I hear
the guns fire I have a twitch of the heart of gnawing
anxiety for my penny steamers. 11.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>
The battle is over, and my penny boats are safe,
thank God! (not in words only, but from my heart).
We had two wounded on board the <i>Bordeen</i>, none
on board the <i>Ismailia</i>. We are meditating an
attack with 500 men on the 50 Arabs, who with
their gun, are at Goba. The <i>Bordeen</i> was struck
by four shells, the <i>Ismailia</i> by two shells, one of
which destroyed a cabin: they had not much musketry
fire, but the Arabs fired a great number of
rounds; they had six guns playing on the steamers.
At noon Arabs fired five shells at Bourré. In the
evening they fired three shells against the Palace
from Goba which fell in the town. Had we not
cased the steam-chest of the <i>Ismailia</i> with wood she
would have had her boiler blown up by one of the
shells. The Arab rifle force of Goba is completely
innocuous; we do not even hear their bullets, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
our bullets reach them, for they cannot stay in the
open, and we can see the dust the bullets throw up
that we fire. Wadji Barra, an Ameer of the Mahdi,
on the north side, sent me a letter (in Appendix
AB) asking me to surrender, and saying it is all
lies about the Expedition, the Mahdi is evidently
(like H.M.G.) offended with my curt answer to his
last, and so his holiness will not write direct.
Whenever we have what we call a victory we fire
some fireworks at the main posts of our lines, which
infuriates the Arabs, and puzzle them as to the
reason. They were very angry to-night, and came
down in a good number, and fired on the Palace
several volleys. I ordered up the three buglers,
who put them to flight. The letter Wadji Barra
sent me was sent by a woman who came to the
North Fort. I telegraphed the officer “Open the
letter and tell me contents.” He did so, and I
answered, “Send the woman back to the Ameer and
tell him to go, &amp;c.” I expect this irritated the
Ameer, who ordered the advance of his men, and
consequent expenditure of his ammunition.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 9.</i>&mdash;A party of sixty men, with ammunition,
camels, and some horsemen, left the Dem of
the Mahdi, and went north this morning. The Arabs
on the right bank of the White Nile came over to the
left bank of the Blue Nile, and went through some
antics, so we suppose something is up. A man was
wounded yesterday at Omdurman, which fort reports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
all right. Letter sent by Wadji Barra in Appendix
AB. The Arabs fired yesterday not rifled shell,
but round shell, which they must have got at
Obeyed, which shows they are out of ammunition
of the regulation sort. What called forth the letter
from Wadji Barra (Appendix AB) was a paper I
issued (Appendix CD) to the town, when I received
Towfik’s telegram saying he would hold the Soudan,
and which I gave to a man to send to the Arabs.
If Lord Palmerston was alive (or Forster was
Premier) he would never leave the Soudan, without
proclaiming the emancipation of the slaves. On 18th
December, 1862, Lincoln proclaimed abolition of
slavery in the United States; this would be a good
day to issue such a proclamation in the Soudan.
Wadji Barra’s letter calls me Pasha of Kartoum,
and says I have been deaf to all their entreaties.
Stewart left this place <i>three months ago!</i> to-day. A
man was wounded by the Arab fire at Bourré: they
fired twelve rounds from these guns at the fort. I
feel sure that the cause of the Mahdi’s coming here
is, that he got hold of Herbin’s ‘French Consul’s’
journal, written in a hostile critical spirit, and
thinking it true, he advanced from Schatt. I expect
Hansall, the Austrian Consul, also wrote in the style
of Lamentations, for he also sent down a journal by
the <i>Abbas</i>. It is remarkable that the very effort
which I made to obtain the ear of Europe should
have thus recoiled on us. I have for the present
abandoned the attack on the Arabs at Goba, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
Omdurman is more important, and as I expect the
Arabs there have taken away their gun; it has
not (up to 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>) fired to-day.  I would like to
ask the Mahdi&mdash;allowing <i>pro formâ</i> that he is
the Mahdi&mdash;what will be his ultimate work?
Certainly his present work is not exhilarating,
firing on his fellow-creatures night and day. The
siege of Sevastopol lasted 326 days. We are
at our 271st day. In their case they had always
their communication open, and they dealt with
an enemy who would recognise the rights of
war; whereas we are not so placed.  They, the
Russians, were united, and had no civil population
to deal with; yet I cannot say I think we are
over great heroes (the fact is, that, if one analyses
human glory, it is composed of nine-tenths twaddle,
perhaps ninety-nine hundredths twaddle). We are
only short of the duration of siege of Sevastopol 57
days, and we have had <i>no respite</i>, like the Russians
had, during the winter of 1854-55; and neither
Nicholas nor Alexander speculated on (well, we
will not say what, but we will put it) “counting the
months.”  Of course it will be looked on as very
absurd to compare the two blockades, that of Sevastopol
and Kartoum; but if properly weighed, one
was just as good as the other. The Russians had
money, we had none; they had skilled officers, we
had none; they had no civil population, we had
forty thousand; they had their route open and had
news, we had neither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 10.</i>&mdash;A slave came in to-day, he had
been with Slatin. He says Slatin is still in chains,
that there are two insurrections in Kordofan, and
rumour is rife that the Expeditionary Force is near.
Fort Omdurman is all right. The slave says the
Arabs have not much ammunition. The Arabs fired
thirty-one rounds at Bourré to-day, and wounded
four men (one an officer, a Major Souleiman Effi,
fatally). The Arabs have been firing stones to-day.
Goba is quiet, they did not fire their gun to-day, or
yesterday. I expect it has gone down to the river-bank.
The slave who came in says the Mahdi’s
return to Kordofan is cut off by the insurrection in
his rear; so we and he are like two rats in a box.
(I wish <i>he</i> was <i>out</i> of the <i>box!</i>) I have ordered the
two steamers to stay up at Bourré, towards which
place the Arabs seem to be directing an unpleasant
degree of attention. (Truly I am worn to a shadow
with the food question; it is one continual demand.)
Five men deserted to-day. The Arabs shape the
stones they fire, like to the shells of their guns; they
will soon spoil the rifling of their guns if they
continue this.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 11.</i>&mdash;The Arabs fired their gun from
Goba three times; one shell fell into the water
before the Palace&mdash;two passed over it. I put down
more mines at Bourré. I have given the whole
garrison an extra month’s pay in addition to the
three months’ they had before received&mdash;I will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
(<i>D. V.</i>) hesitate to give them £100,000, if I think it
will keep the town.</p>

<p>Three soldiers came in from the Arabs who
report advance of the Expedition towards Berber.
The Arabs fired fourteen rounds from their guns
at Bourré. The officers say that there is a European
directing the Arab guns there. (I wonder if
it is that Frenchman who came from Dongola, and
who, I thought, might have been Renan.) Sennaar
is holding out and in great force (so say the three
soldiers), so is Kassala. The Dem of the Mahdi
is altered in appearance. They say he has sent off
the families of his adherents into the interior.</p>

<p>3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;The Arabs fired three shells at the
Palace from Goba; two went into the water, one
passed over the Palace. This always irritates me,
for it is so personal, and from one’s own soldiers too!
It is not very pleasant also to feel at any moment
you may have a shell in your room, for the creatures
fire at all hours. The steamers fired on the Arabs
at Bourré this morning, and one of the Arab shells
struck one steamer, and another struck a santal
which we have there to defend the flank; but
neither did any harm. Two soldiers deserted to
the Arabs to-day&mdash;these men are generally those
who have before been with the Arabs, and had
deserted to us. The Arabs fired another shell at
the Palace this evening, which burst in the air.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 12.</i>&mdash;Small Church Parade. I sincerely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
hope this will be the last we shall have to witness.
We have in hand 1,796,000 rounds Remingtons
ammunition; 540 rounds Krupp; 6000 rounds
mountain gun ammunition; £140 in specie; £18,000
in paper in treasury!! £60,000 in town in paper.
110,000 okes of biscuits; 700 ardebs of dhoora.
This morning I was told a long story of report
concerning the expeditionary force being at El
Damer, near the Atbara river; of how Berber had
surrendered, &amp;c. On tracing it, I found it was a
fib put in circulation by one of the chief Ulemas,
to encourage the people.</p>

<p>3.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The Arabs fired two shells at the Palace;
one burst in the air, the other fell in the water in
a direct line with the window I was sitting at,
distant about a hundred yards.</p>

<p>3.40 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> They fired another shell, which fell only
fifty yards short of the Palace; another burst in the
air. I have sent the buglers up to stop this target
practice. All these shells are in good line for the
west wing, in which the Arabs know I stop. They
fired seven shells in all in this affair; though the
Arabs have fired over two thousand shells at us,
I do not think we have lost by artillery fire more
than three men.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 13.</i>&mdash;The steamers went up and attacked
the Arabs at Bourré (certainly this day-after-day
delay has a most disheartening effect on every one.
To-day is the 276th day of our anxiety). The Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
appear, by all accounts, to have suffered to-day
heavily at Bourré. We had none wounded by the
Arabs; but one man, by the discharge of a bad
cartridge, got a cut in neck: this was owing to the
same cause as nearly blew out my eyes the other
day. We are going to send down the <i>Bordeen</i> the
day after to-morrow, and with her I shall send this
journal. <i>If some effort is not made before ten days’
time the town will fall.</i> It is inexplicable, this
delay. If the Expeditionary Forces have reached
the river and met my steamers, one hundred men
are all that we require, just to show themselves.</p>

<p>I send this journal, for I have little hopes of saving
it if the town falls. I put in (Appendix EF), the
sort of arrangement I would make with Zubair
Pasha for the future government of the Soudan.
Ferratch Pasha is really showing an amount of
vigour I did not give him credit for. Even if the
town falls under the nose of the Expeditionary Force,
it will not, in my opinion, justify the abandonment of
Senaar and Kassala, or of the Equatorial Province,
by Her Majesty’s Government. All that is absolutely
necessary is, for fifty of the Expeditionary Force to
get on board a steamer and come up to Halfeyeh,
and thus let their presence be felt; this is not asking
much, but it must happen <i>at once</i>; or it will (as usual)
be too late. A soldier deserted to the Arabs to-day
from the North Fort. The buglers on the roof,
being short of stature, are put on boxes to enable
them to fire over the parapet; one with the recoil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
rifle was knocked right over, and caused considerable
excitement. We thought he was killed, by the noise
he made in his fall. The Arabs fired their Krupps
continually into town from the south front, but no
one takes any notice of it. The Arabs at Goba only
fired one shell at the Palace to-day, which burst in
the air.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>December 14th.</i>&mdash;Arabs fired two shells at the
Palace this morning; 546 ardebs dhoora! in store;
also 83,525 okes of biscuit! 10.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The steamers
are down at Omdurman, engaging the Arabs, consequently
I am on <i>tenterhooks!</i> 11.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> Steamers
returned; the <i>Bordeen</i> was struck by a shell in her
battery; we had only one man wounded. We are
going to send down the <i>Bordeen</i> to-morrow with
this journal. If I was in command of the two
hundred men of the Expeditionary Force, which are
all that are necessary for the movement, I should
stop just below Halfeyeh, and attack the Arabs at
that place before I came on here to Kartoum. I
should then communicate with the North Fort, and
act according to circumstances. Now <span class="smcap">mark this</span>, if
the Expeditionary Force, and I ask for no more than
two hundred men, does not come in ten days, <i>the
town may fall</i>; and I have done my best for the
honour of our country. Good bye.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c399" id="c399">APPENDIX A.</a></h2>

<p class="pc2 reduct">Letter to General Gordon from Abd el Kâder Ibrahim.</p>


<p class="p2 reduct">In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate,
blessing be on our lord Mahomed, and peace.</p>

<p class="pch p1">From the servant of his Lord&mdash;the Fakeer (humble one) Abd el
Kâder Ibrahim, Kâdi (Judge) of Kalâkla, to his Excellency
Gordon Pasha, Governor General of the Soudan.</p>

<p class="pn1">Now this is what we have to state to your Excellency:
Your benevolence and compassion towards all are well
known, and your special regard towards us is most particularly
known to us, and confirmed by deeds since the
beginning of your presence in the Soudan both the first
and this second time.</p>

<p>That which you have declared in proclamation emanating
from you on your arrival in the Soudan this time is
known to us both publicly and privately.</p>

<p>But the first conviction in the true mission of this
present Imâm, the Mahdi (the expected one, on whom be
peace) from the very beginning (first day) of his appearance,
forbids us to accept your letters or to reply to you.
For we know about him what the Ulema (wise men), who
have wandered from the right way, do not know. And as
the mission of this Imâm, the Mahdi (the expected one,
on whom be peace) is predicted (confirmed) for us and for
you in the ancient books, we cannot incline to (receive)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
your many kindnesses and your regard to us (as shown)
by your favours and your bounties, or forsake the command
of the glorious and Most High God and of his prophet
Mahomed, on whom be peace. We had previously to
this frequently communicated with your Highness. And
on each occasion we explained sufficiently for him who
has a heart (to understand); and in all our communications
we made clear unto you the way of peace and salvation.
But you have not accepted it; nor have you given your
mind to the important object of our call unto you&mdash;which
is the means of your material and moral salvation from
the dangers of this world and the next, (and that both) for
yourself and for the people of the city&mdash;because many of
them are our friends and our relations.</p>

<p>But you have rejected what we have demonstrated to
you again and again. You have listened to the Ulema
whom this world has deceived by its glittering mirage,
making them forget both their own souls and the Moslems,
for the sake of contemptible riches of this life.</p>

<p>Yet their enmity, and giving of the lie, to the Imâm, the
Mahdi (the expected one, on whom be peace), are predicted
in the ancient books, and they themselves are aware of
this. But if they ignore this let them consider the preface
of the book, “Keshef el Ghumma an Jamia el Umma,” by
Shaàrani.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>But you rely upon their sayings and listen to their
words, notwithstanding what has been proved and made
known to you and to all intelligent people of the calamities
and destruction that have befallen the country. This is
the very point (acmé) of your error, and of your blindness
as to what is right.</p>

<p>But because we have not ceased to compassionate you
and the people of the city; and because the supreme Emir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
Abderrahman el Najoomi, and the Emir Abdallah en
Noor and the other emirs with him, have come with a very
great host of troops of all the various tribes which have
submitted to the Imâm, on whom be peace.</p>

<p>(And because) You are utterly heedless as to (the safety
of) yourself and the people of the city, in our exceeding
compassion we have written this to you in return for your
past regard and favour to us. And we beseech God that
it may be accepted (by you).</p>

<p>Besides all this, the noble Imâm himself has arrived at
Schatt, and with him innumerable hosts, and he will
shortly come with his army to the city.</p>

<p>It is therefore our duty to inform you of this in the hope
that you will listen to us, and disregard the words of the
seditious; and that you will submit to this Imâm, the
Mahdi, because, beyond all doubt he is the Imâm, the
Mahdi (the expected one, on whom be peace). And all
the Governments (Powers) will be destroyed by his hand;
for he is supported and made victorious by the power of
God. Be not misled by that which happened in the
Desert (Deem) of Jareef and of the East.</p>

<p>For God made the prophet Mahomed victorious, and
humiliated all his enemies after his defeat in the raid on
Badr and on Ohod, both (which are) well known. And
God gave him unbroken victory (success after that) as much
as he wished and desired. All (the defeat) which has
occurred in the two deserts (deems) before-named is worth
nothing (unimportant). It does not equal (counterbalance)
a tenth of the tenth of those slaughtered in the day of the
battle of Shaikh el Abeed, as is known to you and the
people of the city.</p>

<p>This is our counsel to you, and please God you and the
people of the city may accept it.</p>

<p>And know, O Excellency Gordon, that we have communicated
with his Highness the Mahdi on your behalf;
and his favourable answer has come, (which is) of a nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
to please you and give you confidence, provided that you
submit and obey.</p>

<p>And this is the communication (of the Mahdi) sent to
you by the two Moslem envoys, together with the dervishes,
our allies, who now come to you.</p>

<p class="pr4">(Signed) <span class="smcap">Ibrahim Abd el Kâder</span>.</p>

<p class="pi4">Dated 18 Zu’l Kâdi, 1301.</p>
<p class="pi8">9th Sept., 1884.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;We have sent this reply to your Excellency
with our allies the dervishes, dispatched from the Lord of
all, the Mahdi (the expected one, on whom be peace), and
with the two Moslems, Mahomed Yusuf and George Calamatiano.
And because they were refused at the gates, we
now send it back to you with our son Suleiman, specially
sent by us, who has a letter from the headquarters of the
Imâm requesting your speedy reply to him.</p>

<p>All the emirs here present have given assurance of safe
conduct, in the name of God and of his prophet, to whomsoever
you may send for needful negotiations. And if it
is agreeable to your Excellency, send for our son and for
our friend George Calamatiano for complete understanding
between us and you, as he is both intelligent and friendly
in this matter.</p>

<p>And it appears from your letter that (you consider us)
intelligent and understanding; therefore you should have
believed our report about this Imâm, that there might be
fruit (benefit) derived for all. But we believe that your
opinion of us for sense was inconsistent.</p>

<p>Now God is the Director and Guide into truth.</p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX A¹.</h2>

<p class="pc2 reduct">General Gordon’s reply to [Ibrahim] Abd el Kâder.</p>

<p class="p2">We have received your answer and we have taken note
of all you have said.</p>

<p>With regard to the spies of whom you informed us that
they were entrusted with delivery of the replies&mdash;when
(they) these special messengers arrived at the ramparts,
we did them no harm.</p>

<p>But when we sent a messenger with our answers you
fired with ball upon the slave when he placed the stick
upon the ground.</p>

<p>We received the messenger who came to us from you,
and he saw that we were well.</p>

<p>It would be better that the messengers whom you send
to us should be people of sense, and who know how to
behave. As to the Greek whom it is your intention to
send to us&mdash;the person who has forsaken our religion and
adopted another religion&mdash;we do not wish to receive him,
just as you would not wish to receive a Moslem who had
adopted the Christian religion.</p>

<p>A letter has been sent us by this person aforesaid. It
shows us that he has important information which concerns
the Europeans. But we know that there are many like this
fellow, who have information that concerns the son of
Najoomi.</p>

<p>But perhaps the information about the Europeans of
which he has told us is about the bringing of the European
army to fight the son of Weld el Najoomeh after thirty
days&mdash;for we have now a precious opportunity.</p>

<p>I know that you have been invested with a veil and
robes of honour, and you say that Mohammed Achmed
is the Mahdi&mdash;and I know that there is among you a man
of mature age who has spent his life, from his youth up, in
Islâm&mdash;who would consent to the ruin of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering that I cannot bear the sight of that renegade
traitor, it is preferable that you should send us a respectable
pious man, who may be depended on, to receive
10,000 guineas for the ransom of the Europeans who are
to be found there, and we will send them by his hand;
and if you say that Mohammed Achmed is the Mahdi,
why does he remain in the White (Nile)?&mdash;he ought (if he
is the Mahdi) to take the whole country.</p>

<p class="p2">[The copy above translated is extremely illegible&mdash;evidently
written in haste&mdash;by an unaccustomed scribe; the
handwriting is bad and in Turkish style.</p>

<p>We have surmised that General Gordon employed the
writer as being trustworthy, for among the inhabitants of
Kartoum it must have been possible to find one who could
write better.</p>

<p>George Calamatiano is evidently the renegade whom
the General refuses to admit to his presence.]</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p class="pc2 reduct">Letter to General Gordon from Abderrahman en Najoomi and
Abdallah en Noor.</p>

<p class="p2">In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate,
blessing be on our lord Mahomed and peace.</p>

<p>From the slaves of their lord, Abderrahhman en
Najoomi and Abdallah en Noor, lieutenants of the Mahdi
(the expected one, on whom be peace), to Gordon Pasha.
May God direct him to the truth.</p>

<p>What we state to thee is: First, that thou art a
stranger in the country and to this government, and thou
art intelligent and well informed.</p>

<p>What God wishes to reveal neither men nor demons can
keep secret; and even if they seem to do so God will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
accomplish His design in spite of the infidels. At thy first
arrival at Kartoum the Imâm, &amp;c. (here follow the customary
phrases of respect), wrote to thee to surrender to God and
his prophet, and informed thee of the truth, in which there
is no lie, and assured thee that after that, if thou didst not
submit to the command of God and his prophet, the army
of God will come to thee and will destroy that in which
thou (hast aspired) to share with God thy Creator (in
claiming) rule over His (faithful) servants, while the earth
belongs to God, and He causes whom He will of His
righteous servants to inherit it.</p>

<p>And, nevertheless, thou hast sent to his Highness a reply
different from that desired, and the substance of it (is) thy
refusal to obey and submit to what he commanded thee to
do. Yet in his desire for thy good he waited and delayed
a space of time, expecting that thy sense (reason) would
return unto thee, and that thou wouldst consider thy ways,
nor rely upon this world and its illusions nor on its transitory
possessions (wealth).</p>

<p>Time has now been prolonged, and he has become aware
of thy firm resolve not to obey and submit. He has now
appointed us, the lieutenants above named, and he has
supplied us with trusty men from among his companions&mdash;men
who love death as ye love life, and who count, in
fighting you, on the great reward. Death is dearer to them
than their wives or the very best of their possessions.</p>

<p>One man of them in battle is better than a thousand of
you. He has provided us with weapons of war&mdash;in which
thou thinkest there is victory&mdash;with Krupp cannon, with
mountain guns for battle, in which thou shalt taste of evil
if thou turn aside from the way of God.</p>

<p>The desire of the Mahdi (&amp;c.) is for thy good. He did
not stop at the previous correspondence, but sent you his
messengers with his letter, and he especially sent two
Europeans to counsel thee and make the truth known to
thee; and this out of mercy and compassion to thee and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
those with thee (to save thee) from destruction in this world
and from the evil of torment in the next. Notwithstanding
all this thou hast remained stubborn, and hast turned thy
back to counsel in thy greed for transitory power, from
which thou must soon be removed (by death), either willingly
or unwillingly (either peaceable or violent), and thou
hast replied to the Lord of all (on whom be peace) refusing
to submit, arguing by quotations from the Koran and other
prophecies dictated by thy scribes and thy Ulema, and
thou reliest on their proofs with which thou art not acquainted.
But the fulfilment of those passages is to be
found in the Mahdi (on whom be peace) and his honourable
companions.</p>

<p>And know, O honourable Pasha, and all erring Ulema
who are with thee&mdash;for they do know the truth but do not
counsel thee (aright), because they love the grandeur and
wealth which they have obtained from thee by deceit and
sedition.</p>

<p>And listen&mdash;if thine understanding be enlightened&mdash;to
our advice and to what El Jaber our brother, formerly called
George Calamatino, will advise thee, so that if thou dost
obey and submit to the command of God and His prophet
thou shalt save thyself, and obtain the privilege of saving
those who are with thee.</p>

<p>Otherwise do not doubt but that those and those with
thee will be destroyed within two days, because the lord
of all will, please God, come here, and on his arrival&mdash;should
he still find thee in rebellion&mdash;ye will be destroyed.</p>

<p>Awaiting your decision by bearer.</p>

<p class="pr8">(Signed).</p>

<p>Dated 21 Zu’l Kâdi, 1301.</p>
<p class="pi6">12th Sept., 1884.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;We also inform thee, O honourable Pasha,
that as for the Ulema who are with thee, and on whose
sayings thou dependest, all their children and relations are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
with the Mahdi, and as soon as distress comes to them
they will leave thee alone. Outwardly they are bodily
with thee; but inwardly their hearts are with us. The
news (information) of the city and of thee is constantly
supplied to us by the people of the city. Do not let the
Ulema, the merchants and the servants, deceive thee, for
when thou shalt fall into the grasp (of the Mahdi) they
will not help thee nor protect thee.</p>

<p>Listen to our counsel with an attentive ear.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">From General Gordon. (Reply to his honour the Sheikh
Abderrahhman en Najoomi.)</p>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">Your</span> letter sent by Mr. George Calamatino, who is
called El Jâber, has reached us. That which you have
made known in it is understood. It is true that this is not
my country, and I am a stranger in it, but I am deputed
as Governor-General here by the two great Governments,
and must therefore direct its affairs as becomes my friendship
and compassion for the Moslems.</p>

<p>If there be a man who desires to become a dervish we
do not hinder him. With regard to the Ulema, you state
that they are all liars, and that their words are worthless.
But they have said nothing but what they find declared in
the books; nay, all the Ulema of Islâm are plain on the
subject.</p>

<p>They do not wish to sleep on the (bare) ground, or to
be dressed like dervishes, or to change the clothing to
which they have been accustomed from the beginning of
the Moslem religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>We have never sent answers to His Honour Mahomed
Achmed, or to any others, at dictation of scribe or any of
the Ulema, but by help of the Arabic and English lexicon
in our possession, dictating them (myself) word by word;
and if you do not believe this send us an eminent man, of
good sense, to listen to my words (and hear), whether they
are my own or not.</p>

<p>In proof (of what I say) I have received three dervishes
from Mahomed Achmed. They had with them the robes,
(of a dervish), and I spoke to them many words in
Arabic, and I refused the garments (of a dervish which had
been sent by them). Was that my own doing, or that of
any one else?</p>

<p>But as to the cannons and the guns which ye want to
fight us with, we have still many like them.</p>

<p>We have seen from the letters we receive that the
Mahdi destroys people without cannons and guns, which
is true.</p>

<p>As to the words which George, the Greek afore-named,
has said, we do not see any advantage in them (of a visit
from him).</p>

<p>With regard to the people and the Ulema, of whom you
say that outwardly their bodies are with us, but that their
hearts are with you, and that in the day of battle they will
desert us and flee to you, be it known unto you that we
are not keeping them here, nor preventing them from
going to you.</p>

<p>Their going, or not going, are both alike (to us). Why
do they not go?</p>

<p class="pch">Copy of the answer written by the Ulema undersigned, to the
Sheikh Abdel Kader Ibrahim, and to the son of En Najoomi,
dated 23rd Zu’l Kadi, 1301.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate,
the Destroyer of him who is obstinate against His religion.
Blessing and peace be on our Lord Mahomed and his
successors, who have established the foundations and the
solid pillars (of the faith).</p>

<p class="p1">God has sent down<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> in His glorious book, through which
cometh nothing false, neither in its direct teaching nor in
what may be deduced therefrom. This has been sent
down by the All Wise and All Worthy of Praise (saying),
This day I have completed<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> your religion for you, and
I have perfected unto you My grace, and have granted
unto you Islam as (your) religion; which is the last verse
sent down to the Chosen One (Mahomed). After this let
no one heed any saying or accept any act which is not
dictated in the Book or the Soonna. But if there had been
any (fresh) Revelation on which reliance could be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
for superseding any law of the (established) laws of Islam,
it would involve accusing the precious Book of lying; for
after completion no new thing can be added.</p>

<p>Moreover, it has been unanimously agreed that (anything
claiming to be) a revelation of the prophet, on whom be
blessing and peace, if its sense differ from the Law, that
revelation is not to be acted upon, but must be set aside;
and it is one of the absolute conditions of him who contends
(for the faith) that he should not violate the unanimous
agreement, that he who utters the double confession (of
faith in God and the prophet) has (thereby) secured safety
for his life and his property, unless by the Law (right) of
Islam as is written in the Hadith;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> and this Law (right)
of Islam has been defined in the whole of the true Hadiths
(namely) that breach of chastity and murder are contrary
to Law (right) and (constitute) apostacy from Islam.
And among apostates (is he) who forsakes his religion and
causes schism in congregation as is (found) in the Hadiths.</p>

<p>Now this pretender to the office of Mahdi is causing
schism in the congregation and has broken the staff (unity)
of Islam, and has ruined the abodes of the Moslems,
plundered their property, dishonoured their women, and
made some tyrannize over others, as is in accordance with
their apostacy, because they have made lawful the killing
of the faithful, the dishonour of their women, and the
plunder of their property, and calling them Kafirs (infidels)
without cause, though these are observing (or defending)
the laws of religion, and walking in the firm road (way of
truth); moreover, the majority of his followers are sorely
troubled by what they have seen of slaughter, infamy,
pillage, and taking of captives, nor are they with him body
and soul (heartily), the proof of which is that only a few days
passed before some of them came to seek assistance from
the Government against oppression, famine, and nakedness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of letters have come, some of them from you,
in which are a number of erroneous statements, wherein
the Sheikh el Akbar says that the Most High God has
appointed for the Mahdi a divine host of Ministers (Vizirs),
whom God has reserved for him in the depths of His
secret councils; He has revealed them declaring and
witnessing about the Creation, and that which God has
commanded for His servants; also that the Mahdi does
nothing except by their counsel; and that they are
Persians (foreigners), not one of them is an Arab, yet they
speak nothing but Arabic; that they have a chief, Hafiz,
who is not of their race, who has never at all rebelled
against God; he is the chief of the Vizirs. Their number
does not exceed nine, nor is it less than five. To every
six there is a Vizir, who has special knowledge and
functions. Here ends the quotation.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>But where are these foreign Vizirs, and that one among
them who professes that he is an Arab? and what about
their excess above that number?</p>

<p>And with all this you accuse us Ulema of error from the
way of truth, and say that you know what others do not
know; whereas, between you and him that has even the
very least knowledge, there is a very wide gulf.</p>

<p>And in those letters you address His Excellency the
Governor-General (Gordon) as Sáadat,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and yet they
contain accusations of his being a Kāfir (infidel). Is not
this to use terms which contradict each other?</p>

<p>In them you also say that the certain proof as to this being
indeed the Mahdi, the Expected One, on whom be peace,
was accepted by you at the very beginning of his manifestation,
and forbids you to receive letters or to reply to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>Also in some of your letters you say that you have been
among the number of his Vizirs for the last thirty years.
How is this after what you wrote lately under your seal to
your Sheikh el Abeed, that whoever believes that this
Mahomed Achmet is the Mahdi must needs be a Kāfir
(infidel), because there has not come any Hadith, or revelation,
or Athar, but shows to all the world the true
nature of this man; therefore to believe in him would
involve giving the lie to him, on whom be blessing and
peace, who is, above all, worthy to be believed?</p>

<p>Here is contradiction? Since your love of the world
has actually perverted you even into saying of him, “Peace
be on him.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> (‘Alaihy es salaam.)</p>

<p>But the Prince<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> (of the faith), Abd el Ghani, the Nablusi,
said in his book, the Hadik en Nadih, the commentary on
the Mahomedan religion, No one ought to be distinguished
by the salaam (after his name) excepting the prophets, for
one cannot say, Ali, on whom be peace (salaam); and this
rule applies both to living and dead alike, excepting that a
person present may be addressed thereby, for people say,
Peace be upon thee. Here ends the quotation.</p>

<p>You have pretended that the coming of the Imam the
Mahdi, the Expected One, is proved for us and for you in
the ancient books, and that it is impossible for you to incline
unto us, and that the hostility of the Ulema against the
Imam the Mahdi and their giving the lie to him are both
proved and mentioned in the ancient books, and you call
the attention of the Ulema to the book <i>Keshef el Ghummah
‘an jamia’ el ummah</i> of Shaàrani. But here, if you
meant this for the ignorant who do not know the ancient
books or <i>Keshef el Ghummah</i>, that might do, for there is
not in all the ancient books any reference or allusion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
concerns or points to any Mahdi. Nay, it has been denied
by the greatest men as being unsupported by any Hadith
or testimony, and it originates with the Shiahs, who pretend
that our Lord Mohammed, son of the Hanafiyeh, will
appear, and also his father ‘Ali, in the clouds. But, if we
admit the sayings which seem to prove that there will
be a Mahdi, where is the Khorassani, brother of him
who is appointed Mahdi who is to prepare the way for
him before his appearing? and where is the Safiyān who
was to be king before him? and where is the arm which
was to appear with the hand pointing (as if to direct)&mdash;This
is the Mahdi. Follow him? And where is the
dwindling of the Euphrates displaying the mountain of
gold? Or have you found in him the tokens revealed by
the prophet of God, on whom be blessing and peace, that
the Mahdi will not disturb any who is sleeping nor will he
shed blood. But there are proofs to you and to all that
he has shed blood, and has disturbed sleepers to so great
an extent that you have made bold to say that he will
destroy all governments. Now if what is said about him
and what you tell us about him (be true), what would be
the fruit of joy and favour to those who submit to him,
since the end is destruction?</p>

<p>Now the old books still exist. Produce, therefore, someone
who can show us what you have asserted, for we have
found no trace of your assertions as you have set them
forth, especially because it is known to everybody who
knows this man who pretends to be Mahdi that he has
neither tribe nor relations of illustrious origin, and the tribe
of which he comes is very small indeed, nor is it (strong
enough) to give victory in any matters of religion to him
who may come forth from it; and as to his standing alone
and separate from any family, which you have put forward
as indicating the validity of his claim, that in truth is a
notable proof of its worthlessness; for, as the learned
Imam Ibn Khaldoon said in his preface, of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
extract a literal copy and send it to you herewith, from
which you will learn that he is not justified in his claim,
and that the religious mission without (the support of)
family will not abide, for every matter of public concern
absolutely needs (the support of) family; and a following
and mob of ignorant folk cannot be called family; but
(the support of) family consists in ancestry and kindred,
in whom support is to be found. Let not his pretension
deceive you in that he says he is of the house (of the
prophet), for this is not known or proved amongst people
of position. But, if that were granted, have you seen with
him any of the kindred of the prophet who help him to
victory? The whole of his arguments in favour of his
claim (establish) the contrary, and his proofs and evidences
are such as decide against the truth of his claim. And if
you had looked with the eye of justice, and followed the
right, you would not have believed in this pretension, or
have called on people to respond to it, while threatening
them with death, pillage and more. But it was your duty
to advise<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> the Moslems and not to take up arms against
them. Have ye not read, He who kills a believer intentionally
merits Jehennam everlastingly, and the wrath
of God and His curse are upon him, and great torment is
reserved for him? Or (have you read) the Hadith&mdash;He who
has borne arms against us is not of us? Or the command of
the prophet, on whom be blessing and peace (who says), In
killing [a Moslem] he has broken the staff (unity) of the
Moslems, for their interests are one? And the Hadith&mdash;The
believer is brother to the believer; he may not oppress
him or betray him? And the Hadith&mdash;One believer is to
another like (the stones of a) building; they support one
another? Then he, on whom be blessing and peace (in so
saying), clasped his hands (locking the fingers together by
way of illustration).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>Also the Hadith&mdash;He is a believer to whom people have
confided their property and their lives, and he has accomplished
the Hegira who flees from sin and transgression.
The believer is the mirror of the believer, and the believer
is brother to the believer who shelters him from harm, and
protects him from his pursuers?</p>

<p>Also the Hadith&mdash;Whoever casts a look upon his brother
believer to terrify him unjustly, God will terrify him in the
day of Resurrection?</p>

<p>Also the Hadith&mdash;The believers are as one man. If he
accuse his head, he accuses the whole body; and if he
accuses his eye, he accuses the whole (body)?</p>

<p>Also the Hadith&mdash;The (true) Moslem is he from whose
hand and tongue Moslems are safe, and the believer is
he to whom people have confided their blood (life) and
their property?</p>

<p>We have looked at the preface of <i>Keshef el Ghummah</i>,
and found that the author said in it&mdash;The prophet, on
whom be peace, announced to me that this book will remain
until the appearance of the Mahdi, on whom be peace, and
his followers will profit by it, and by it will be able to dispense
with the advice of the Mahdi in most matters of
religion, for when he, on whom be peace, is come, he will do
away with contradictions and differences of opinion on the
earth, so that in his days there will remain none but the
pure faith, and the body of the Ulema of his day will be
secretly hostile to him.</p>

<p>But there is not found in it that the Ulema err from the
way of truth, but (there is found) they are to be excused
for their thought when they see him differing in doctrine
from the doctrine of their Imams on account of their conviction
that there is no authority above the authority of
their Imams; yet they would submit to him for fear of his
power and through coveting the wealth he possesses, for
he and the prophet are brothers, and no one will oppose
him but will fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>Also in the Hadith (it is found) that they (? he) will
follow the steps of the prophet, blessing and peace on him;
he will be infallible, and he will not decree as to what is
lawful or unlawful excepting as he, on whom be blessing
and peace, would have decreed if he had been alive. He
will not surpass any of their Imams in knowledge and
thought in the least. This is what ought to be acted upon,
and this as regards him who has attained such a degree of
profound knowledge (of religion) that he has arrived at
differing (ventures to differ), though the Imams are against
him.</p>

<p>But your Imam has not attained this degree of profound
knowledge, for he knows nothing of the six sciences on
perfection, on which this profound knowledge depends.
Besides which, he has forsaken the axioms which are
among the essentials of religion.</p>

<p>But the Sha’arāni himself, from whose book you quote as
guide, has said in his book <i>El Yawakeet w’el Jowahir</i>
(‘Rubies and Jewels’) that the Mahdi is to be son of
Hassan el Askari, and his birth will be in the night of the
middle of Sha’abān, two hundred, fifty and five, and he
remaineth until he meets Jesus the Son of Mary. (Sha’arāni)
said, “Thus was I informed by Sheikh Hassan el Ar’āki
when he met with me, and my lord Ali el Khowas confirmed
the same.”</p>

<p>End of the quotation.</p>

<p>Now if his birth was in the year two hundred, fifty and
five, and he is to be appointed Mahdi as a youth, as is
found in the Hadiths, and (seeing that) from since then
that one thousand and forty-six years have passed, while
the age of your Imam does not amount to the tenth part
of those years, how can you quote the evidence of Sha’arāni
on your side and convict us of error by him, while he
is quite clear in (saying) that which contradicts this
pretension? Whereas if he (the Mahdi) had laid claim
to sovereignty, that would have been more agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
to his (Sha’arāni’s) saying:&mdash;He has made his claim
because the people followed him. For the Governor-General
here does not prevent any one from going to him
or to any one else, but the roads are open to all who
please; notwithstanding which the people do not cease to
come in crowds and crowds, desiring the protection of his
government; and he protects them, and is beneficent to
them, and provides for them; whereas it is just the opposite
with those who go to you, even the envoys. And if you
doubt this, stop the seizing of booty and the killing of
deserters, and pillage after fighting, and see after that who
will follow you? For without doubt there are those who
do so under compulsion, and are distressed thereat, and
wrongly imagine that this is from the Turkish Government.
But now we and you are here in the Soudan, and there
is not one here of the Turkish Government. If you were
to come to Kartoum you would not find a Turk. Why,
then, is this war? Is it for the ruin of religion, the slaughter
of Moslems, for the overthrow of houses and mosques, for
the burning of the books of the religion of Islam and the
killing of the Ulema, or to close the way against the
pilgrimage of the Hajj (to Mecca)? And this is (your)
Mahdi’s work!</p>

<p>Now, because it has been declared in the <i>Sabbeehh</i> that
religion is sincerity to God and His prophet, and His
Imāms the Moslems and their people, we have written this
unto you, in the hope that you will understand it and will
act accordingly before you are hemmed in by the evil of
your deeds. And as to this business, since its close and end
are close at hand, we remind you thereof, and if that which
we have enlarged upon is not sufficient for you, then let
your Ulema and your notables come to examine the matter
in a place where both parties will feel secure. For there is
the Book and the Soonna, and let them bring about union
between us, and God will guide whom He will and cause to
err whom He will. But if this does not commend itself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
you&mdash;although it is enjoined in the saying of the Most High,&mdash;If
you should differ in anything submit it to God and
His prophet, if ye be believers in God and in the last Day;&mdash;(then)
attend to our proposal and come; let us call our
sons and your sons, and our wives and your wives, and ourselves
and yourselves, and consult, and lay the curse of
God upon the liars.</p>

<p>And be not misled by that which you have mentioned
about the slaughter of Moslems in Kordofan and in the
engagement with your Sheikh el Abeed, for this is nothing in
comparison with what happened to the Moslems in the raid
of Tithār and the slaughter of Nebuchadnezzar in the Holy
House,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and the destruction thereof, and the war of Tamerlane,
and others beside, which are written in the books,
as will be understood on referring to them; also in the last
war, in which were martyred, by the Beni el Asfar,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> a
number of Moslems past counting. And after the great
wars and destruction of countries the Moslems have not
seen any result injurious to the faith. Was not the Caaba
overthrown by the engines of war? Were not the Imām
Hussein and his family slain at Kerbela? Now, if all this
proves that he who conquers has right on his side, why,
then, did you not follow the conquering government which
subjugated the Moslem countries?</p>

<p>Moreover, as to the two engagements you have mentioned,
and those who were killed in them, some of them
were killed by thirst and some by treachery. And it is well
known that war resembles the buckets (on a wheel like see-saw;
one up, the other down).</p>

<p>We are ashamed to reply to the foolish comparison you
draw about the raid of Badr and that of Ohod, as we are
also ashamed to reply to your Imam, who places on a level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
with the righteous Khalifs those weak (miserables), poor in
faith, who are like brute beasts and even more ignorant.
Were we to answer that, it would take too long, wherefore
we lay hold of the reins of our pen and stop it from running
in that Maidān (race-course).</p>

<p>And God will direct in the right way.</p>

<p class="pi6">Signed and Sealed.</p>

<p class="p1 reduct">Endorsed&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc reduct">“Letter from Faki Mustapha to Cassim el Moos, Melet of
Shaggyehs. No seal to it.”</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate,
the bountiful Ruler.</p>

<p class="p1">Blessing upon our lord Mahomed; and on his successors
and peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">From the servant of his Lord (without Whom he has no
strength), the Fakeer of God Ahhmed el Mustafa the
humble theologian, faithful to Mohammed, to the beloved
and virtuous Cassim el Mousse, the Melek (king) whom
may God ever preserve.</p>

<p>After wishing you abundance of peace, I greatly desire
(to see) you. May God never separate me from you or
deprive me of you. And it is well known to your honour
that after seeing you, and (after) your enlisting in our
ranks (in faith), besides the previous friendly ties which
draw us nearer to each other, that we have been very
anxious about you and still think of you night and day;
and more especially when you were in Baghshuda, and as
was believed, near the Imâm, on whom be peace. Until
(we heard that) the Most High God has delivered you in
His mercy and goodness; and when you came to this town,
inhabited by oppressors. And (when) it was the will of
God that thou shouldst enter into this town our anxiety
about thee increased on account of what we know of the
power of the Mahdi, which no Government can withstand.
And when a party of his enemies were destroyed we made
inquiries as to those who were slain, being anxious (feeling
compassion) for thee.</p>

<p>And we pray to the most High God, publicly and
privately, to deliver thee out of it (the city) in safety. And
when we heard that you had departed from it to the Halfai,
we returned thanks to God for the sake of your children
and of our children, (both) for your safety and for your
departure from among them. Praises be to God for this.
We declare to you, O Beloved! that as to truth (of the
mission) of this Mahdi (that) our being in his service is
sufficient for you, if you believe in us. Do not pay attention
to the Ulema of Kartoum who pretend that Gordon
is right whilst he is the most determined of enemies to
those who believe in the glorious Koran.  But it was predicted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
before his appearing, that the Ulema would be
hostile to him and that he would kill them. Also that the
nobles would be hostile to him and that he would fight
them and kill some of them even (if they took sanctuary)
under the curtains of the Kaaba (at Mecca).</p>

<p>And this man is that very Mahdi who will perform those
deeds. And as soon as we were convinced of the truth of
his mission, we arose and submitted unto him. We left off
study of the glorious Koran, and the (public) prayers on
Fridays, and laid hold of him because he is the unfailing
support (= rock, a phrase applied to God). We have not
ceased to think of you, and when you were in Kartoum
we tried to get the safe conduct, and we obtained it, for
yourself and for your property and your children and your
wives and all your followers&mdash;explicit, sealed and signed,
and beyond chance of fraud or pretence. God is my
witness in what I say.</p>

<p>I tried to get that good tidings into the town to you,
but could not find the way till God heard my prayers and
did not disappoint my hopes concerning you, so that
your wife and her mother came to the Mahdi, on whom be
peace, and I obtained their safe conduct.</p>

<p>I am most deeply anxious about you lest you should be
(imprisoned) again with those people, whose ways God
hath straitened (who are in difficulties), for the Imâm, the
Mahdi himself (on whom be peace), has arrived at Schatt
fifteen days ago. And he has honoured us these two days
by writing (from him).</p>

<p>If it is in your power to bring away with you all you
have of arms and ammunition and ships (steamers), meet us
with them&mdash;that will obtain for you great honour in the sight
of the Imâm, and of his honourable followers; but if not,
God will not require of any man more than he is able to do
(quotation from the Koran). Then come by yourself, and
if you leave behind you any property do not mind it, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
you will obtain that at the conquest (of the city) without
diminution. Be not troubled as to what has happened
between you and the Fakeers in the East. It is a small
matter considering the indulgence of the Imâm, on whom
be peace. What you did will not be accounted as misdeeds
compared with the misdeeds of Salehh Lik when he killed
the Yakoobāt, and plundered their property; and the sons
of the Mukâtify, and plundered their property, and took
their children, although they were noble. In spite of all
that, he is nearer than any other man to the Imâm, who has
forgiven him, and given him full pardon.</p>

<p>Do not take account of what you have done, but come
out to us secretly, if not openly&mdash;that we may convince you
of the truth (genuineness) of the Mahdi&mdash;by whom in His
mercy God has strengthened our weakness. But beware of
delay, for I fear that after his arrival here you will not find
the way (open) to come to us, nor will our entreaties
avail.</p>

<p>Do not heed the ignorant talk of the Ulema of Kartoum,
or to the pretences (ideas) of people who heed carnal
things rather than sacred. Wherefore God has sealed their
hearts so that they do not know. They are (foolish) like
ostriches, yea they are inferior (to them).</p>

<p>Oh, my beloved, come by yourself&mdash;or with those who
are with thee if thou canst&mdash;but beware!&mdash;beware of delay.
I warn you earnestly against going back to Kartoum after
God has brought you out from thence.</p>

<p>Hasten to us that we may help you before it be too late.</p>

<p>The time of the Turks is over. The rope (line) of their
dominion is cut (severed), and what God has cut cannot be
mended. Do not hang upon (attach yourself to) that
which has been cut, and which is declared by the chosen
(people) of God to be indeed cut; as was declared by His
prophet, on whom be peace.</p>

<p>Now, according to what we know of your intelligence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
knowledge (we say) do not be misled by the changes of
this life,&mdash;for the days are few. (It is only for a time.)
Peace be with you.</p>

left in their hands but Kartoum only.</p>

<p>The sum of 55,000 guineas at Berber has been taken by

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c425" id="c425">APPENDIX E¹.</a></h2>

<p class="p2">A Proclamation from Gordon, addressed to the people of
Kartoum, preceded his arrival. He told them that, knowing
of the general regret caused by the severe measures of
the Government for the suppression of the slave traffic,
and the seizure and punishment of all concerned, according
to convention and decree, he had resolved that none should
interfere with their property, and that henceforth whoever
had slaves should enjoy full right to their service, and full
control over them. When the terms of this document
reached Europe, a storm of indignation was raised against
both the law and the giver. Its terms were greeted as an
insult to the honour of England, and as a violation of all
the traditions of philanthropy. Few paused to consider
who was the author of the concession, few to consider what
that concession meant; almost all were as ready with their
blame as but a short while before they had been prodigal
of their praise. The implacable enemy of slavery was now
its friend, and in the name of England had declared his
change of front. What would the world say to this, and
what could England say to the man who, however exceptional
his character and career, had thus misrepresented
her?</p>

<p>Perhaps this proclamation, in Europe the motive of so
much silliness and ill-feeling, did more than anything else
towards enabling Gordon to win Kartoum. From the
moment it reached the town the attitude of the inhabitants
changed; sullen apathy was converted into joyful expectation,
and thousands who had been ready to welcome the
Mahdi became eager to show homage to Gordon. It was
altogether a brilliant diplomatic conception, the work of a
man who thoroughly understood the character of the
people whom he addressed. It restored to those people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
rights of which they had been robbed, and which they were
now in a position to regain for themselves whenever they
would. Yet in the simple gift of what was already theirs
lay the opportunity of avoiding much bloodshed and
misery&mdash;an opportunity which Gordon’s insight into
national characteristics enabled him to understand, and his
rapidity of action enabled him to grasp. By the treaty of
1877, the Soudanese were permitted to hold their slaves
until the year 1889; and this treaty was made when
Egypt had no notion of relinquishing her possession of the
country. Yet it was known to be useless, as its conditions
could never have been carried out. The avowed object of
Gordon’s mission to the Soudan was to remove the Egyptians,
and to hand it back to its own children, an operation
which in itself involved the permission to hold slaves for
ever. Had Gordon said, “I come to concede you the
Soudan, which is, when I leave, to be governed as you
wish, but after 1889 you must not hold slaves,” the Soudanese,
and the whole of Europe, would have thought him
mad; but as he said, “I come to concede to you the Soudan,
which is, when I leave, to be governed as you wish, so
that you will have the right to hold slaves as long as you
like,” it was only the Soudanese who were able to see the
sense and value of the concession, and to call its author
mad was a privilege reserved for certain European philanthropists.&mdash;<i>The

Soudan.</p>

<p class="pch p1">[This Report was made by H.E. Hussein Pasha, Mudir in the
neighbourhood of Aloob in Kordofan, and it remained passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
from hand to hand among the rebels till we heard of its existence.
We demanded it, and received the following copy,
which I transmit just as it is.]</p>

<p class="p1">On Saturday, 2nd of Moharram, 1301, was accomplished
the arrival of the detachment of troops in the vicinity of
Aloob, which is near the government seat of Kordofan, by
the will of the Creator.</p>

<p>On inspection of them (the troops) it was found that
they had suffered from excessive thirst and the not finding
sufficient proper drinking water for the detachment, on
account of the loss, six days before, of the guide who was
appointed to lead the way, and on account of ignorance of
the places where drinking water was to be found.</p>

<p>The consequence of which was to throw the square into
a state of confusion, to the extent that privates could not
recognise their companies nor officers their men. The
transport also was scattered&mdash;I mean that the animals were
scattered singly (without control). It was then that Monsieur
Hicks, commander of the detachment, ordered the
men and officers to collect in order. But as one of the
commanding officers of the detachment disobeyed, he
referred the matters to Alî ed Deen Pasha, to see to
bringing the detachment into order. But his Excellency
answered him that he himself was the commander, and
responsible. The consequence of which was to cause
universal weakness and paralysis. We met a body of
troops and were all surrounded in one place, and on account
of what I have said&mdash;and for want of water until Sunday,
as we did not find enough to last till then&mdash;and thus, it was
impossible to escape destruction.</p>

<p>But oh, alas for the Government authorities!<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
(themselves) secure from danger. But if the will of the
Most High God has ordained our death, (so far) delayed,
it will be from thirst and not from anything else.</p>

<p>I, the writer of this report, am called Hussein Pasha,
Mudir, an officer of the Home Government in the army,
a native of Egypt&mdash;one of those raised from the ranks;
and I adjure you by God, who (may) see what I have
written, (if) you are believers in God and his prophet that
you will make this known to the Government authorities.</p>

<p>The will of God be done, and there is no escape from the
decree of God, Who hears and knows all things. May your
life be prolonged.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">Letter from General Gordon to Ibrahim Abd-el-Kader, Kâdi of
Kalakla.</p>

<p class="p1">This moment we have received a letter from the General
of the English troops (stating) that the English troops who
arrived in Dongola have killed the Fakih (theologian)
El Huda and the Shareef Mahhmood who was sent from
Mohamet Achmet for the blockade of Dongola&mdash;and
they have (also) killed all the dervishes who were with
them; and they are marching straight on Berber; and that
the steamers we sent last week have arrived at Berber and
found it perfectly desolate and empty. They entered it
and seized the two steamers which were lying there. And
(the General states) that Mahomet el Khair fled from
them, and that before this he had deluded the people and
told them to come to him to meet the army ready for
Berber; some of them would not go, but some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
went to him, and when they asked him for their expenses
he sent them to an empty room to take the cash. When
they found no cash there he told them that it was in the
possession of a Jin (demon). They were astonished at this.
But when they found that the whole thing was deceit from
beginning to end they returned to the places whence they
came. Now, because you are one of our old friends, and
because the brotherhood between us is a fact known to all
people, we send you this news which we received seven
days ago; and now we have very greatly strengthened the
defences of Kartoum and its mines. We are now preparing
an earthquake by means of electricity, and I fear for you
on its reaching your place; nor do we wish you to be
among the others (when it takes effect).</p>

<p>Tell the son of Najoomi and Abu Kerjah to go to
Dongola. It is better for them; and later on, when we
are arranging matters, we will make them Sultans.</p>

<p>Do not say that Kartoum is starving, or eating dogs and
asses. I swear that such provisions are not to be found
with you as are to be found in Kartoum&mdash;both eatables
and drinkables. We do not desire your immediate
submission to the Government, lest Mohamet Achmet
should suspect you; nor should we wish you to obey
Mohamet Achmet, but that you should remain neuter
until you see what will happen. As I know that you need
soap for washing your faces, I here send you a small box
of that wherewith we wash our faces.</p>

<p>Salute the son of Najoomi from me, and tell him (that)
to-day there came to us a man from your side, like a
peacock, from the quantity of coloured patches ornamenting
his mantle, so that the inhabitants were astonished
at him.</p>

<p>A letter from the Ulema to Mohamet Achmet is also
sent to you. Please forward it to him safely.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c430" id="c430">APPENDIX K.</a></h2>

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Abd el Kâder Ibrahim, Kâdi of Kalakla, to General
Gordon.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>

<p>Praise be to God the bountiful Ruler&mdash;with blessing on
our lord Mahomet, and peace.</p>

<p>From the servant of his lord Abd el Kâder Ibrahim&mdash;the
Kâdi of Kalakla to Gordon Pasha.</p>

<p>Three times have we warned you, sufficiently for people
who have sense; and all on account of your friendship for
us, of which you spoke in your letter.</p>

<p>This was for your safety and for the safety of the poor
and of the Moslems who are with you in the city. But
neither our warnings nor our arguments have taken effect
upon you.</p>

<p>You write to us every time that you are steadfast in
denying (the mission of) this Imâm the Mahdi, on whom
be peace.</p>

<p>But nothing has led you to this false conclusion except
the enmity between the Moslems and the infidels&mdash;and the
sayings of the wicked Ulema who are with you at Kartoum
as well as the love of supremacy and of this life&mdash;and the
desire to continue therein. O delusion! delusion! (go to!
go to!)</p>

<p>But know that all that thy informants have told thee,
and of which thou hast told us, is false; for had there been
anything in it we were better informed than (any such
things taken place we had better opportunities of knowing
it than) thou; because the post and (other) communications
pass by night and by day in all parts (of the country)
which has submitted to the Mahdi, upon whom be peace.
And if such things as you mentioned were to happen that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
would not weaken his title to be Mahdi. But the Imâm
the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, is victorious; and beyond
all doubt he will destroy all rebels and hypocrites, although
he were left alone in the world without a man with him, as
has been proved by evidence and by eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>Such communications as you send do not please the
hearts of the auxiliaries (of the Mahdi)&mdash;especially of their
Emirs&mdash;for by God, they are firmly resolved and determined,
and every one of them comes and goes (being)
willing to die; and they are not afraid of threats by word
or deed. But under all circumstances they trust in God.
For this Mahdi is right. English troops or chemicals
(electricity) or stores of ammunition will not avail against
the Mahdi. What will avail (you) is to return to the truth
and cast away what is false; and for all to submit and
surrender to this Imâm, upon whom be peace.</p>

<p>There is no deliverance or safety excepting in him; and
if you really have friendship for me, as you say, listen to
my words and benefit by them, and surrender yourselves
with the Moslems,&mdash;otherwise the day will soon come
when you will learn who has been the greatest liar.</p>

<p>As to the box of soap sent by your messenger, it has
reached us, and here we send it back to you rejected;
because your sending back the present of the Imâm the
Mahdi&mdash;upon whom be peace&mdash;compels us to return your
present. And how could we do otherwise than return it,
when you sent back the present of the Vicegerent upon
Earth of God, and His prophet, upon whom be blessing
and peace? Whereas acceptance of a present promotes
goodwill.</p>

<p>In fine, this letter now (last) sent has done nothing but
increase the ill-will; for if you and the people of the city
had known the facts about the auxiliaries of the Imâm,
upon whom be peace, who are now (in arms) against and
around the city, you would not have written this, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
would simply have surrendered&mdash;if so be that God wills
your safety and that of those that are with you.</p>

<p>This is my advice to you. (Surrender.)</p>

<p>God is the guide into all truth, and unto Him all return
and submit.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Abderrahhmân en Najoomi and Abdallah en Noor
to Gordon Pasha.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God the merciful and compassionate.
Praise be to God the bountiful Ruler, with blessing on our
lord Mahomed and his successors, and on whom be peace.</p>

<p>From the servants of their Lord Abderrahhmân en
Najoomi and Abdallah en Noor to Gordon Pasha, representative
of England and of the Khedive. May God guide
him into truth. Amen.</p>

<p>We have to state to you that as to thy presence in the
Soudan this last time, and thy first letter to the Imâm the
Mahdi, on whom be peace, and as to thine appointment by
the Khedive; the Imâm the Mahdi, on whom be peace, has
written to thee, and has shown thee the truth in leading
thee to God; and also that which concerns thy salvation
and that of those with thee, and how thou mayest attain
salvation in this world and in the next.</p>

<p>Thou hast replied to his Highness (in a manner) contrary
to that (which was) expected (of thee) rejecting the truth,
whether for or against thee. After we arrived with our
hosts to fight thee and drive thee into submission&mdash;willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
or unwillingly&mdash;the Imâm, out of compassion for thee and
those with thee, a second time exhorted thee to surrender
to the command of God and his prophet, and gave thee the
covenant (in the name) of God and His promise that if thou
didst surrender thou shouldst be (assured of) safety, with
thy children, thy property, and all that thou hast, (thus)
securing to thee the same (privileges) as to us, and the
same (duties) as are required of us.</p>

<p>You have received that letter of his by his messengers
the Moslems whom he appointed from thence to advise
thee, after our arrival in this (desert) Deem. But neither
you nor those with you have accepted the call (wherewith)
God and His prophet have called you.</p>

<p>You answered as you did to our lord, and you demanded
a thing of Abd el Kâder Ibrahim, when el Jâber the
Moslem came (to thee), (who was) one of the messengers
sent to thee for negotiation&mdash;(but) thou didst send him
back. Yet we had sent him to thee in our intention for
good and in our goodwill towards thee and towards those
with thee. And we wrote to you the advice which reached
you. Nevertheless, you did not listen to the truth nor
accept it&mdash;because the will of God must be accomplished.</p>

<p>We had therefore resolved not to correspond any more
with you, nor to communicate with you except by the
sword and such like weapons, until we have destroyed your
glory and your strength departs (from you) and we pluck
you out by the roots when we seize you in our grasp.
However, yesterday your messenger arrived with a letter
from you to our brother Abd el Kâder Ibrahim, in which
you deceitfully counsel him and try to seduce him from his
religion, and in which you tell him to desire us and Aboo
Kerja to go to the Dâr el Gharb (West) (as being) better
for us&mdash;because when you are arranging matters you will
make us Sultans. But every man of sense knows that all
things are in the power of God and not in your hand, nor
in that of those who appointed you, nor in that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
English, on whom you depend. And you lie unto the
people with you about their arrival (the English) at Dongola,
and about their killing Sheikh Ahhmed el Huda and
the Shereef Mohammed; and that they were going straight
to Berber; and that Mahomed el Khair<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> the Emir of Berber
ran away from them, and made fools of the men with him
when they asked him for their pay. As to your promise
of making us Sultans when you settle the affairs of the
country as stated in your letter, and your statement that
the steamers sent last week by you had found Berber
desolate and deserted, and that the two steamers found
there had been captured, we have learned from this letter
of yours that the steamers you sent did not seize anything
at Berber except only the steamers, and it is known to
all the world that the Moslems captured a quantity of
Government stores which were in Berber. But you do not
mention having seized any of them&mdash;only the steamers.</p>

<p>Lying does not become a Pasha such as you.</p>

<p>And we received the day before yesterday a letter from
Mahomed el Khair telling us that he was on the shore&mdash;both
east and west&mdash;ready to fight your steamers. And,
please God, they (the steamers) with the guns, will not go
back to you a second time. But the last will overtake
(redeem) the first, and you will not hear of them again.
We did not think that with your intelligence and your
knowledge that God has strengthened us in His earth,
you would have told us lies or tried to frighten and deceive
us, and those who are with us, by talking of things (already
better) known to us, and of which we have constant
information, (receiving) news day and night from all parts
of the world.</p>

<p>And you seem to have chosen for us, that we should go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
back to the West (Dâr el Gharb;) trying to deceive and
mislead us through desire for the life of this world, and (as
though) we covet (the dignity) of being Sultans and (to
have) dominion. But we call upon thee to come to God
and His prophet, and to follow the right faith, and to reject
the religion in which thou art, and to adopt the religion of
our prophet Mahomed, on whom be blessing and peace;
and the fellowship of his Khâlif Mahomed, the Mahdi, on
whom be peace. If thou wilt do this thou shalt have
honour in this world and in the next.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if thou dost still look forward to the coming
of the English, who, as thou pretendest, have reached
Dongola, and are going to Berber, know for certain and
be sure&mdash;and accept the advice we give thee on the subject&mdash;that
all the Soudan country, except Kartoum and the
towns of Sennaar and Dongola, is all of it in the hands of
the Mahdi, and in the possession of his honourable friends.
From the extreme border of the Soudan to Suakin, and to
Reef, no one shares with them (in the possession thereof).</p>

<p>The Government who sent thee as Governor-General
does not possess a single hand-breadth of ground.</p>

<p>The English came several times to Suakin. They were
killed (fought) by one of the lieutenants there&mdash;Oshman
ibn Aboo Bekr Digna&mdash;who has captured all their armies
and the booty thereof.</p>

<p>Therefore, look to thy own safety elsewhere without (relying
on) them, and prepare thyself for what may happen
to thee before their arrival. For the whole English Government
(nation) could not pass by way of Suakin or Dongola.
But even if the English were to come God would kill them
by the hand of His faithful before they (could) reach you.
Know that the Imâm the Mahdi, on whom be peace, has
sent us for the sole express purpose of fighting thee and
as advance-corps to prepare the way of his army and of
his Highness.</p>

<p>But whereas thou hast been appointed Governor on behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
of two eminent Governments&mdash;and as thou sayest that
thou hast come to arrange the affairs of the Soudan&mdash;thou
wilt not find a better opportunity for carrying out thy
intention and desire successfully than (now) in these two
days before the arrival of the whole army.</p>

<p>But if thou and those with thee in the town delay&mdash;awaiting
the English&mdash;till after the arrival here of the
whole army and the noble presence (of the Mahdi) you will
be disappointed in your hope and desire. Therefore it
(will be) much better for thee to collect all thy forces and
come out to meet us beyond the fortifications, from which
we are but an hour distant.</p>

<p>Then thou and thy men may attain your wish, and go
back to your fortress, happy in having fought us. But if
thou dost delay until the arrival of the whole army and of
the noble presence, we are certain that you will not then
think of fighting or of hoping to possess (conquer) any
more.</p>

<p>It can therefore only be your excessive fear of us which
prevents your coming out and fighting us. Soon, please
God, thou and those with thee will be in our grasp, and
will taste the sore evil (result) of your unwillingness to
follow the way of God.</p>

<p>Know oh! Excellency Gordon, that whereas thou hast
said in thy letter to Abd el Kâder Ibrahim that thou
wast diligently working in preparing an earthquake, and
didst fear for him when it should reach him, that thy
saying is nonsense, unworthy for an intelligent being to
utter.</p>

<p>Has the Earth, indeed, brought out to thee her demons?
(for thy service).</p>

<p>Thou hast tried to frighten him by saying that thou wast
coming out thyself to fight and kill us, and didst order him
to leave us. But this (coming out to fight) would have
pleased us better.</p>

<p>The earth is (become) too straight for thee, wide though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
it be, and thy ways (of escape) are cut off. Look out for
thyself (to find) way of escape from the judgments (vengeance)
of God and of His prophet. For we have thee by
the hair of the head, through the power of God and his
will.</p>

<p>As to the answer sent by the Ulema to the Imâm the
Mahdi, on whom be peace, we have sent it by a special
messenger to be placed in his hands. But do not thou
rely on the lies they tell in it, because since the reply
which they sent by Jāber the Moslem, in which they
denied in the strongest terms (the validity of the claim of)
the Mahdi, they sent messengers and letters to the
Mahdi, on whom be peace, apologizing for what they wrote
to him, and for what they may (in future) write, making
oath to him that they are compelled by you to utter these
things for fear of their life, and (only do so) pending the
arrival of his noble presence, and they pray him not to
have any ill-will against them for what they may say.</p>

<p>If thou hast sense, do not regard what they write, but
have it sent through you.</p>

<p>And whatever you may find to your interest and for the
prolongation of thy dominion, about which thou art deluded,
and from which thou shalt soon depart, please God, do it
without their advice or counsel, for all they show thee is
only deceit, till they (can become) master of their opportunity
to join the Imâm the Mahdi, on whom be peace.</p>

<p>As to the favour which God has granted to Sheikh
Ahhmed el Huda and Shereef Mahmood and the faithful
ones with them to die as martyrs, that is the ultimate
object (of desire) for all followers of the Imâm the Mahdi,
on whom be peace, and what they have promised him (to
do), and what they pray God may honour them (in
granting to them).</p>

<p>We pray God to grant us the favour He has accorded to
them, and to bestow on us the honours of martyrdom,
pleasant in His sight. And we continue in prayer to God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
to make us among His beloved ones honoured by Him
with martyrdom. For He has the power to do this, and
to Him it appertains to hear (prayer).</p>

<p>What we have said is enough. God has the guidance in
His hand.</p>

<p class="p1">[The length of these letters, and the persuasions used, even the

<p class="pc1 reduct">Letter from General Gordon to the Honourable the
Sheikh Abderrahhmân en Najoomi.</p>

<p class="p1">Yesterday we wrote to you (as to) the arrival of the
English troops in the neighbourhood of Merowé, and to-day
also we have received letters from the troops, and herewith
we send you a specimen of the correspondence; and
although it it is very minute we have read it with a magnifying
glass. But you must open your eyes well that you
may yourselves see its minute letters. English troops have
arrived in the neighbourhood of Merowé; ten regiments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and the rest are behind
them in Dongola and Wady Halfa. (We are informed)
that the Mudir of Dongola has killed the Fakir (Theologian),
Ahhmed el Huda, and the Shereef Mahmood, who is the
uncle of Mahomed Achmed, sent from Kordofan. Every
one of their host was destroyed. Other information has
reached us by special messenger from Berber, that our
steamers have entered and are awaiting the arrival of the
army.</p>

<p>Before now we announced in one of our proclamations
issued to the inhabitants after our arrival, that we had
repeatedly advised the people to give up (their rebellion)
but they did not return (to allegiance) and that we should
be obliged to bring English troops to this country to
chastise the rebellious and bring them to submission. But
I suppose you considered these words to be lies until this
army arrived near to Berber, (an army) which no strength
of theirs could withstand.</p>

<p>A few days ago we sent you notice to go to Kordofan
and remain there, and that we would make you one of the
Sultans of the West. You had better listen to this advice
and go with your men and be happy with them, obeying
your Sultan Mahomed Achmed.</p>

<p>Information has reached us that you have made contracts
with the Arab sheikhs for bringing provisions upon
their camels, (for) about 1000 camels, and (that) the sheikhs
received from you a quantity of ready money for buying
provisions and ran away from you. All the Soudan
soldiers hate you and have come to us; but if we are bad,
as you imagine, these soldiers would not have followed us.</p>

<p>Mahomed Achmed informs us that he ordered Aboo
Kerjah to convert us to his faith, but this fellow understands
drinking Merissa (<i>i.e.</i> date-beer) better than anyone
else, and we think he may teach us Merissa-drinking.</p>

<p>Please God, the soap we sent yesterday to Sheikh Abd-el-Kader,
to wash his face with, may be found like (as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
as) the towel which Mahomed Achmed sent to Mr. Costi
(Cuzzi) Moosa to wipe his face with.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>The guns we fired yesterday were (in rejoicing at) news
of the coming army.</p>

<p>Therefore the first and best thing (for you to do) is to
consider the news sent you herein enclosed, and arise and
go back to your places with whatever you have of guns and

<p>Yesterday we sent you an answer to your letter brought
to us by your messenger, who is going back, in which we
told you to come out of the fortress to meet us in fight
before the arrival of the standards (troops) sent to us from
the Imâm Mahomed, the Mahdi, on whom be peace, as
we are now near to you&mdash;within eyesight. And (as)
probably you will not have another opportunity after these
two days. But you have not done so.</p>

<p>Even to-day we have received your letter and proclamation,
both sealed and signed by you, which are not
satisfactory answers to our letter. But you put in them
nonsense&mdash;like unto dreams.</p>

<p>But we are better informed than you; for the hands
(power) of the Mahdi, on whom be peace, are over the
whole world; and he receives news from all parts thereof.</p>

<p>We are not inside a fortress listening to the sayings of
hypocrites, who run away like slaves, and the like&mdash;on whose
authority you issue lying and deceitful proclamations.</p>

<p>You mention in your answer<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> that you have received a
letter from the troops; but on looking at it we find (that it
is) a proclamation from you, with your own seal, and not
from the army.</p>

<p>How can you say so, and contradict yourself? From
this we learn that all your sayings are lies. And after this
let there be no more letters or communications between us
and you; but (only) war.</p>

<p>The proclamation is enclosed (returned).</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">Letter from Lieut-Colonel Stewart, C.M.G., to General Gordon.</p>

<p class="pr4 reduct p1">Island of El Hassa Heya, 4 miles south of Berber,</p>
<p class="pr6 reduct">14th September, 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4">You will no doubt be surprised at our not having yet
passed Berber, but the fact is, we had several vicissitudes
the first couple of days. You know already what happened
the first day, how through the ignorance of the captain and
the Reis, we ran into the bank and damaged our wheel.
The second day the captain ran us on to a mud bank,
where we stuck for four hours, and were with difficulty got
off by the <i>Saphia</i>. This was too much for my patience. I
am sorry to say I lost my temper and rather severely
handled the individual, turned him out and put the second
in command; on the 11th we passed safely through the
Shoboloha defile. We saw the broken end of the telegraph
cable which is to the south of the defile. Anchored for
the night opposite the village of Om Ghirka, and on the
right bank, at a small cultivated island inhabited by
Shaggyeh, whose chief is Bab Bekr el Mek, a brother of
Cassim el Moos.  His people received us very well;
supplied us with all the wood they could get. The chief
came on board, complained greatly of the dervishes,
but said, with the exception of the Shaggyehs all the
tribes were wholly with the Mahdi.  I enclose a letter
which he has written you. He begs you will send soldiers,
rifles, etc., when he will openly declare himself for the
Government. So far as I am able to judge, the Shaggyehs
are strong for the Government. At the Shaggyeh villages
we passed, the people all showed their joy at our appearance
by dancing and shouting. The villages were all along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
the right bank. The left bank was sullen, if not openly
hostile. Bab Bekr reported that a boat full of dervishes
had been recently up the river, collecting tithes; the
<i>Fascher</i> steamer also appears to come up now and then.
The Arabs also appear to have received news of our
expedition. During that night war drums were being
beaten on the left bank. On the 12th we received some
shots from the left bank, and about mid-day halted at a
Shaggyeh island for an hour or so, where we got some
wood. The people were again friendly. Beyond this
island we got into the Djaalen country. Passed Metemma,
where we saw crowds of people and several flags; were
fired on, but distance too great to do any harm. Soon
after reached Shendy. Here we were also fired on. The
Government house has been loop-holed, and there is a small
breastwork wall in front of it. The <i>Saphia</i> threw a couple
of shells into the town. Saw a man with a letter making
signs to us, so stopped a little below the town, but he did
not come on. Halted again at an island and looted the
village on it; killed a lot of cattle and pulled the houses
and Sakkéyés down. We were again fired on from the
left bank, and the war drums were beaten all night. On
the 13th we found both banks of the river openly hostile.
Close to the low hills of Om Ali, on right bank, we saw a
gathering of horse and foot; fired at them and knocked
over a horseman.  Below this point we had to hug the
right bank very closely, and some Arabs turned out, ran
alongside the steamer, waving swords and lances. We
could have knocked them over with the greatest ease, but
refrained, as they were so plucky. In the afternoon looted
a boat going up with sugar. Halted on right bank about
an hour and a half above El Duem. War drums going on
all night. On the 14th we spent the day destroying Sakkéyés
in a systematic manner, taking them one after
another. They gave us a fine supply of wood, without
which it would be absurd to go on to Berber. Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
think we have destroyed fifteen to twenty Sakkéyés.
This evening, when halted, have noticed a number of horse
and foot come from the north to the village opposite on
right bank. After looking at us for some time they retired,
apparently in the direction of Damr. I suppose they came
to reconnoitre, and perhaps to attack us while destroying
Sakkéyés. To-morrow we shall start before daybreak, and
the steamers will escort us to the other side of Berber. I
think everything now is in fair working train, and am
sanguine of getting through all right.</p>

<p>At the village of Bab Bekr, an Egyptian soldier came on
board who had belonged to the Berber garrison. He had
been sold for fourteen dollars to a certain sheikh, who is
said to have a lot more of his comrades. I shall send him
on as baksheesh to the Khedive. So far as I am able to
judge, with the exception of the Shaggyeh, the whole
country is with the Arabs; have no certain news about
Dongola, beyond that the garrison is strong. Some have
told us there is a large Egyptian force there, but others
appear to have no knowledge of it. Cannot say much in
favour of the men on <i>Saphia</i> and <i>Mansowrah</i>. They will
think of nothing but loot, will not work, and scatter about
in the most dangerous way. Omar Bey appears to have
little control over them. I must, however, say that both
he and the steamer captain have done everything in their
power to assist me, and more especially the captain of the
<i>Mansowrah</i>.</p>

<p>Both Herbin, myself, and Power, wish to be remembered
to you. You may depend upon it that I shall do everything
in my power to assist you. Thanking you for the very
great kindness with which you have overlooked my shortcomings,
and praying that the blessing of the Almighty
may abide with you,</p>

<p class="pr6">I remain, my dear General,</p>
<p class="pr8">Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">O. H. Stewart</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">P.S.&mdash;How I wish you were with us.</p>

<p>I have advised Omar Bey on account of the very
indifferent quality of his troops, who are no better
than an armed mob, to be very careful how he lets them
land anywhere. He tells me he has now fuel sufficient to
remain two days at Berber, and steam again some distance
up the river, and that he does not intend to allow them to
land. I confess I think he shows his discretion. The incident
I mentioned of the Arabs running alongside our
steamer and defying us with sword and lance, impressed
me vividly with their daring and recklessness. I am afraid
our miserable troops would be scattered as chaff before the
wind by them. As far as Shendy you may consider the
right bank, if not wholly friendly, is not at any rate
openly hostile.</p>

<p>With that exception the whole country so far as I have
seen is hostile. The Djaalen have I am afraid gone over
heart and soul to the Arabs. All our successes and failures
are known everywhere. Mahomet Ali Pasha’s defeat is
perhaps exaggerated.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that the country is in fine cultivation,
and the people working away at their irrigation as if
nothing was the matter. South of Shendy on right bank
they did not run away at our approach, and even north of
that place some few remained and looked at us unconcernedly.
Most however, north of Shendy, ran away, or
fired at us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>From El Sayet Eltahen and Hamed Idreer to Issat
Osman Bey, the Colonel and Commander of Omdurman
Station, and to all officers with him, our brethren
in God. After many salaams and anxiety to see you,
we write as friends and companions of the same religion,
and as there has been no animosity or hatred existing
between us up to the present day, we inform you
that the Government of Egypt is no more under the
Turkish Empire, but the English have taken possession
of it, and you, being Arabs and Moslems, how would you
then remain with the infidels and join Gordon, who has no
one except slaves and other very low class of people, and
Kartoum being surrounded on all sides with great numbers
of troops, notwithstanding the approach of the Descendent
of the Prophet, our Iman, and the Iman of all Moslems,
Mohamed Achmet, the Mahdi, son of Abdullah, who has
come to a very short distance from Omdurman with an
unlimited number of troops, how Kartoum can oppose
them. When we saw these signs, we have hastened to
write to you these lines, and ask you to come with all your
belongings and join our Emir, and that you should be
admitted into the fellowship and take security. You had
better not delay until Wednesday, because the Immaum is
expected either to-morrow, Tuesday, or Wednesday. So do
not procrastinate one single day. Come before the Immaum
comes, and you will be well received and well treated;
the same as happened to those who have come before you.
You are, no doubt, aware of the mercy of our Emir Ahmad
el Mostapha; and the Mahdi has sent orders to the said
Emir, and instructed him that all who come out from
Kartoum or from the fort should be given security and
receive no harm. Therefore, you should send two messengers
to meet us, and inform us of your designs; and
we hope to be the cause of your safety. Let it be known
to you that our Emir is like the ark of Noah&mdash;whoever
comes to it will be saved, and who refuses will perish in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
deluge; so do not procrastinate not one day. The Emir
was in communication with you at first, to send messengers
from your part, in order to come to an understanding; but
now there is no time for that. One single day will be
enough to cause your perish. On account of friendship we
send you this advice; and God is a witness of the truth of
our statement. You are strangers in this country, but not
strangers to our religion; but Gordon is a stranger to
both. Now then, would you leave us and join him? We
are told that Gordon Pasha is telling you that the English
are coming. What if they come? What can they do to
our troops? We are very certain that the English who
are at Suakin have all perished by Osman, and those who
are at Assouan are besieged there, and have fortified themselves
there, and given up the Soudan; so all the projects
of that infidel are failing, and also the steamer of Stewart
Pasha and the Consul was caught at the cataract, and
those who were on board were all killed. We send you
also a letter addressed to Farratch Pasha el Zeeb. Should
you think right, send it to him; and, if you fear the result,
tear it up and destroy it. Leave the others and come and
be saved. We are here near you; come to us secretly,
and leave those infidels to their fate. Send Ibrahim your
servant, with those you chose to send as messengers, as he
is trustworthy, and we can deliver any secret to him. We
await your early arrival, so as to go together with Emir
Mustapha, on Tuesday the 23rd El Hajah, to the Mahdi.
Peace be upon him!</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Faki Mustapha to Commandant Omdurman Fort.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>From the servants of God, Ahmed el Mustāpha, the
Governor of the Mahdi, on whom be peace, son of El Iffah
el-Ameen to Issat Osman Bey Caimmakam of the Omdurman
Station, and to all the officers and soldiers, may God
direct the right.</p>

<p>Good friends, we have so often called you to God and to
His Apostle, and to his Mahdi (Reformer), on whom be
peace, in our letters, but you have neither come nor sent
us messengers. But inasmuch as the Fakirs performing
patrol duty, and the sentinels tell us that you do not fire
upon them if they fire at you, and if they pass close by
you you do them harm, hence we hope good of you, and
hope of God that you will be directed to the Mahdiship.
And now the man of the times has come, the Iman of all
Moslems, the successor of God’s Apostle our Lord Mahomed
the Mahdi [Reformer], son of Abdullah, to a place
near to us one day’s journey from our camp. Out of
solicitude for God’s creatures we have taken the trouble to
write this to you after having done so already repeatedly;
and we have sent you your Brethren, Saddeek, son of
Taher, and Hamid el-Shâyib, in order that you should
meet them outside beyond the Fakeers, and agree with
them on the plan which shall spare your property and
children, and write you to us before the arrival of the
Mahdi, lest you be lost with those who are lost, which God
forbid. You know our solicitude for the people, and that
we do not interfere with the property or lives without legal
authority. Therefore do not fear us, neither the Imâm, on
whom be peace, and who is better than we and better than
all God’s creatures, excepting God’s Prophet. Therefore
you shall have security from God, His Prophet, His Reformer
[Mahdi], and security from me also, who am God’s
humble servant. Keep this as a document to witness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
against us, sealed with my seal, both in this world and the
next, that if the least harm befall you, your children, or
your property, if you write yourself to me this night, which
is the night before Tuesday the 24th el-Hijjah, for fear lest
you delay further you will find no other opportunity of
reaching us, and will perish. We have already informed
you that this Mahdi is the true and expected Reformer
who shall possess the eastern parts and the western parts
of the earth. Will he therefore be too weak to conquer
Kartoum, in which there are only base people and people
having no following? And we know perfectly the number;
and they are in want of their relief from the North, which
has been cut off; and the steamer called <i>Kartoumiah</i> has
been taken, and the Fakeers have killed those who were in
it, and it was sunk over against Gordon like the people of
Seba. Do not therefore destroy yourselves with him.
Those admonished you out of pity for you that you may
be among those who are saved, not among those that
perish. If you listen to my words, come out to your
Brethren, and afterwards come to us, and we will speak
about that which will be for your interest, that is to say,
we will agree with you on the delivery of the sentinels by
night, so that the morning will find the Fakeers there, and
will find you with your property with your Brethren here
in the camp, and to-morrow we will meet the Imâm near
here, and you will have saved yourselves. But if you reject
our words you will rue it, and I have thus admonished
you.</p>

<p class="pc reduct">Letter from Slatin Bey.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">His Excellency Gordon Pasha, Governor-General of the Soudan:</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Your Excellency</span>,</p>

<p class="pi6">I have learnt through George Calamatino, the bearer
of the letter from Mahomet Achmet, that your Excellency,
not knowing the true facts of the case, judges my proceedings
and capitulation disparagingly. I therefore take the
liberty of informing you of the true state of affairs as they
are and as they have been, and beg that you may form
your opinion of me accordingly.</p>

<p>Since my appointment as Governor of Darfur, I have
been engaged in warfare with Sultan Haroun and Dud
Benga, and when the revolution, caused by Mahomet
Achmet broke out, I was left in Darfur without officers;
some of them had been killed, some had been dismissed by
the Government, and the few remaining ones were not fit
to take a command. At the first outbreak, even of hostilities
which were simultaneous with those of Achmet el
Arabi in Egypt, I was compelled personally to take a
command. After several battles, all more or less unsuccessful,
the Arabian officers who bore me a grudge and firmly
believed in the victory of Achmet el Arabi over the
Europeans, gave out among the soldiers as their opinion,
that the cause of my defeat lay in my being a Christian.
In order to stifle these injurious opinions, I gave out that I
had for some years already practised the Mahomedan
religion and now publicly proclaimed my conversion. By
this step I had regained the confidence of my soldiers,
inspired them with hope, had given them a happy confidence,
uprooted malicious intrigues and conducted several
successful battles until the annihilation of the army in
Kordofan commanded by Hicks.</p>

<p>Whether by my conversion I committed a dishonourable
step is a matter of opinion&mdash;it was made more easy to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
because I had, <i>perhaps unhappily</i>, not received a strict
religious education at home.</p>

<p>I commanded in Dara against the tribes known to your
Excellency as Razagat, H. L., &amp;c., and in spite of great loss of
life and want of ammunition, we were full of glad confidence
in Hicks’ reserves, but after the annihilation of the latter the
demoralised troops refused to fight any longer. I had now
at my disposal about 700 soldiers, counting sick and
wounded, and for each gun ten to twelve dozen cartridges.
Officers and men demanded capitulation, and I, standing
there alone and a European, was compelled to follow the
majority and compelled to capitulate. Does your Excellency
believe that to me, as an Austrian officer, the surrender
was easy? It was one of the hardest days of my life.</p>

<p>By submission and obedient behaviour I have attained a
certain degree of confidence amongst the local magnates,
and have thus received permission to write to you, because
they are of opinion that by these lines I am requesting your
Excellency to surrender.</p>

<p>Should your Excellency not despise my feeble services
and small knowledge of tactics, I beg to offer you my help,
with no desire for a higher post of honour only from
devotion and friendship for your Excellency and the good
cause. I am ready with or under you, for either victory or
death. My few faithful ones here, my fortune, &amp;c., all&mdash;all
will I gladly desert to die, if God so please, an honorable
death.</p>

<p>Should you accept my services, I beg your Excellency to
write me an answer to these lines in French, but in Arabic
the following letter:</p>

<p>“Seek to obtain the permission of Seid Mohamed
Ebn Seid Abdullah,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> to come to Omdurman in order to

PROPHET, 1881-83, TO THE DEFEAT
OF HICKS’S ARMY.</a><a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></h2>

<p class="pn1"><span class="smcap">For</span> many years the creed of Mahomed has been making
immense strides in Central Africa, where it seems to
have a peculiar fascination for the native races. The
number of converts has been estimated at from eight to
twelve millions, and the idea of the regeneration of Islam
by force of arms has gained a strong hold among them.
On the appearance of the False Prophet in the summer of
1881, thousands flocked to his standard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Biography
of the
Mahdi.</div>

<p>The person in question is a Sheikh named Mahomed
Achmet, the son of a carpenter, and a native of Dongola.
He was born about the year 1848, and educated in a village
near Kartoum, where he studied religion. In 1870 he
became a Sheikh, and after a short stay at Kaka, near
Fashoda, took up his residence on the island of Abba, in
the White Nile. There he gradually acquired a great
reputation for sanctity, and in time assembled a considerable
number of dervishes, or holy men, round him. He
augmented his influence by marrying daughters of the
leading chiefs of the Baggara Arabs,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and, by his power
and tact, succeeded in uniting the various tribes.</p>

<p>In May 1881, when living at Marabieh, near the island of
Abba, he first advanced his claims to being the Messiah, or
Prophet foretold by Mahomed. By his followers he was
styled “El-Mahdi,” more usually, but incorrectly written
“El-Mahdi.” This is an Arabic word meaning simply a
“Leader” or “Guide,” and is not found in the Koran. In
the early days of Islam, it was not unfrequently used as a
name or title. The notion which prevails among Moslems
generally, regarding the expected great “El-Mahdi,” is,
that he will be a descendant of the Prophet, and will appear
towards the end of time to uproot wickedness, to avenge
the blood of the Imams who were slain unjustly, and to
establish a reign of righteousness on the earth.</p>

<p>The Ulema<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> of Kartoum did not hesitate to pronounce
against Mohamed Achmet, and he was likewise discredited
at Cairo and Constantinople, and soon became known as
the “False Prophet.” Among many reasons for disbelief,
one was, that the Redeemer of the World, promised in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the Koran, would come from the East, and not from the
West.</p>

<p>The intentions of Mahomed Achmet, as set forth in
various proclamations, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>To gain over the whole of the Soudan to his cause, then
march on Egypt and overthrow the false-believing Turks,
and, finally, to establish the thousand years’ kingdom in
Mecca, and convert the whole world.</p>

<p>The principles of his teachings were universal equality,
universal law and religion, and community of goods. All
who opposed his mission were to be destroyed, whether
Christian, Mahomedan, or Pagan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes of
rebellion.</div>

<p>The religious fanaticism of the native tribes of the Soudan
was, however, only one of the many causes of the insurrection
which broke out after the appearance of the Mahdi.
The principal one appears to have been hatred of the
Government, due to&mdash;</p>

<p class="phang p1">(1.) The venality of the Egyptian officials, and the
oppressive and unjust manner of collecting the
taxes, and especially to</p>

<p class="phang">(2.) The suppression of the slave trade. Most of the
supporters of the Mahdi, more especially the Baggara
tribes, owe all their wealth to the traffic in
slaves, which the Egyptian Government has now for
many years been taking measures to put an end to.</p>

<p class="p1">The time selected for the rising was after the garrisons
of the Soudan had been diminished for reasons of economy.
Lieut.-Colonel Stewart is, however, of opinion that the
military weakness of Egypt was not any real cause of
the rebellion, as he believes the troops in the Soudan would
have been sufficient to quell it had they been properly
handled.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1881.
July.</div>

<p>In July, 1881, the attention of Raouf Pasha, the Governor-General
of the Soudan, was drawn to the pretensions of
the Mahdi; and he sent a commission of inquiry from
Kartoum to interview him, and ascertain the true state of
affairs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11th
August.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Military
expedition
sent to
bring the
Mahdi to
Kartoum.</div>

<p>On their return, it was determined to send a military
expedition to Marabieh to bring the Mahdi to Kartoum.
A force of 200 men left the latter place by steamer on the
11th August, reaching Djeziret Abba in 15 hours. There
they disembarked, and advanced towards the residence of the
Mahdi. When quite close to it, they suddenly found themselves
in the presence of 4000 to 5000 of his followers,
armed with swords and lances.  The troops fired one
volley, but were almost immediately overpowered, and
forced to retire, leaving behind them 120 of their party
dead, among whom were the two officers.</p>

<p>After this, the Mahdi sent emissaries to all the neighbouring
chiefs, calling on them to join him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concentration
of
troops at
Kawa.</div>

<p>The Governor-General, on hearing of the disaster, ordered
all the available troops from Kartoum, Sennaar, Fashoda,
Kordofan, and Berber to assemble near Kawa, on the
White Nile. The garrisons were left so weak that hardly
sufficient troops remained to carry on the ordinary duties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1881.</div>

<p>Great excitement prevailed in Kartoum, which had no
defences of any kind; and the inhabitants commenced to
agitate for the construction of earthworks.  Fears were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
entertained that the insurrection would spread rapidly, and
even that the slaves, who formed more than half of the population
of the town, would rise. Many were of opinion that a
large garrison of Egyptian troops was absolutely necessary
to ensure safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.
Inactivity
of the
troops at
Kawa.</div>

<p>By the end of August 1881, 1,400 troops were concentrated
near Kawa. There they remained idle for more
than a month, and then dispersed to their quarters without
having made the slightest attempt to follow the Mahdi,
who had retreated into the mountainous district of Takalla.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
It is probable that, had he been resolutely attacked, he
would have been defeated, his followers would have deserted
him, and the rebellion, with all its disastrous consequences,
would have been crushed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8th December.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
Rashid
Bey at
Jebel
Gadir.</div>

<p>Rashid Bey, the Mudir of Fashoda, twice asked to be
allowed to march against the Mahdi, but on both occasions
permission was refused. At length, acting on his own
responsibility, he set out with 400 regular soldiers, and 100
Shilluk negroes, led by their chief Kaikun, and after a four
days’ march reached the camp of the Mahdi, on the mountain
of Gadir,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> on the 8th December. In the fight which ensued,
Rashid Bey and the greater part of his troops, including the
Shilluk Chieftain, were cut down by the Baggara horsemen.
But few escaped to carry the news of the defeat to Fashoda.
A large quantity of rifles, ammunition, and stores fell into
the hands of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>Great fears for the safety of Fashoda were entertained at
Kartoum, and 200 soldiers were immediately sent there by
steamer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<div class="sidenote">15th March.</div>

<p>It was becoming more evident every day that a regular
campaign would be necessary to quell the rebellion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
that reinforcements of men and matériel were absolutely
necessary. Large numbers of irregular troops from the
Shaikiyeh,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Dongola and Berber districts were enrolled,
and armed at Kartoum. Nubir Yussuf Pasha, who had
formerly seen service under Gessi Pasha,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> was put in command
of them. On the 15th March he left Kartoum with
a force 4000 strong to operate against the rebels in the
Shilluk country, but by the time he reached Kawa, several
hundreds of the irregular troops had already deserted, and
gone over to the enemy, and he remained there with the
rest of his force inactive for several weeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th March.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of Abdel Kader
Pasha as
Governor-General
of the Soudan.</div>

<p>Raouf Pasha, the Governor-General of the Soudan, was
recalled to Egypt on the 4th March, and Abdel Kader
Pasha was appointed to succeed him. Pending the arrival
of the latter, Giegler Pasha assumed temporary charge of
the Soudan.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the concentration at Kawa, the
rebels attempted to make themselves masters of the district
of Sennaar, and had many minor successes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6th April.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the garrison
of Sennaar.</div>

<p>On the 6th April, the garrison of the town of Sennaar
attacked a large force of Arabs, led by a nephew of the
Mahdi, who were encamped in the neighbourhood, but the
attack was repulsed, and the Egyptian troops, having
suffered great loss, retreated to the town, and shut themselves
up in the Government buildings, which they succeeded
in defending.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<p>They were followed by the rebels, and for three days the
greater part of the town was given up to murder, plunder,
and fire. Many of the inhabitants, as well as 14 foreign
merchants, 9 officers, and more than 100 soldiers, were
killed. The losses of the rebels were also very considerable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
As soon as the news reached Kartoum, reinforcements
were ordered to Sennaar from Kalabat,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Katarif,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
and Kawa. On the arrival of a detachment from the last-mentioned
place, the rebels retired towards Karkoj,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> which
had already been some time in their hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread
of the
rebellion.</div>

<p>About this time the Shilluks<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> were reported to be in
revolt, and the news from Darfur was far from re-assuring.
The insurrection appeared to be gaining ground in every
direction, and the position of the Government was becoming
most critical.</p>

<div class="sidenote">15th April.</div>

<p>On the 15th April a detachment of 200 troops left
Kartoum, and proceeded up the western bank of the Blue
Nile. About the same time some Bashi-Bazuks, under
Ali Kashef, arrived at Abou-Haraz (at the junction of the
Blue Nile and the Rahad) from Katarif, to act on the
eastern bank of the Blue Nile in conjunction with several
thousand Shukuriyeh,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> under the Sheikh Aud-el-Kerim
Bey. By operating on both flanks, hopes were entertained
of speedily restoring tranquillity in the Province of Sennaar.
No engagement of importance took place till the end of
the month, when 150 Egyptian troops were cut to pieces
by the rebels near Mesalameh.</p>

<p>During April the Mahdi with the bulk of his followers
still remained on the mountain of Gadir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">State of
affairs in
Kordofan.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<p>News received from Kordofan stated that 15 soldiers
at the frontier Post of Abu Haraz (west of El-Obeyed<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the way to Shaka<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>) had been killed, and that 150 soldiers
stationed in Nuba,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> for the suppression of the slave trade
had been recalled to El-Obeyed. The inhabitants of the
last-mentioned place were arming themselves, and constructing
entrenchments. 6000 rebels were reported to be
encamped in the neighbourhood, and an attack was
expected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd May.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the rebels
at Abou
Haraz by
Giegler
Pasha.</div>

<p>By the end of April a considerable force had been
collected on the Blue Nile, and Giegler Pasha placed himself
at the head of it. On the 3rd May he attacked the nephew
of the Mahdi, Sherif Ahmed Taha, near Abou Haraz (on
the Blue Nile). The fight was obstinate, and the troops
made but little progress till Sheikh Aud-el-Kerim Bey
came to his assistance with a large body of Shukuriyeh,
2000 of whom were mounted, and clad in armour.</p>

<p>The rebels were at length overpowered. The Sherif was
amongst the slain, and his head was sent to Kartoum, and
publicly exposed. In the telegrams announcing the victory,
Giegler Pasha made no mention of the assistance he
had received from the Shukuriyeh, but spoke only of the
bravery of the Khédivial troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25th May.</div>

<p>On the 25th May Giegler Pasha appears to have gained
another victory over the rebels in the neighbourhood of
Sennaar, in which 800 of them, including their chief, were
killed.</p>

<p>On the 16th May the tribe of Hassaniyeh Arabs, living
along the road from Kartoum to Kordofan, having been
reported to be in revolt, 200 soldiers were sent to Tur-el-Hadra,
on the White Nile. They were to be followed by
600 more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<p>Communication with Darfur, Sennaar, and Fazokl was
interrupted.</p>

<p>At Kartoum the formation of irregular regiments of
Shaggyah and Dongolese was being actively pushed forward.
Reinforcements were coming in from Berber, and
were mostly sent on to Kordofan, where great insecurity
prevailed. Large quantities of warlike stores and some
guns were reported to have reached Berber from Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">27th May.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rashid

<div class="sidenote">3rd June.</div>

<p>On the 27th May Rashid Pasha, Chief of the Military
Posts along the Abyssinian frontier, reached Kartoum, and
left on the 3rd June for Kordofan, whither more than 1000
troops had already preceded him. It was supposed that
he was to be appointed Hokmdar of Darfur, Kordofan, and
Dongola.</p>

<p>Of the doings of the Mahdi, and the state of affairs in
Darfur, there was no news.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th June.</div>

<p>The Mudirieh of Sennaar was still far from being pacified,
and, on the 9th June, a force of 20,000 rebels was reported
to be a day’s march from the town of that name. The
insurrection was also reported to be spreading to the
districts south of Karkoj.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th June.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
Yussuf
Pasha
near Jebel
Gadir.</div>

<p>Towards the end of May Yussuf Pasha, who had done
little or nothing since March, was ordered to advance from
Kawa against the Mahdi, still supposed to be somewhere
near the mountain of Gadir. After great delays he set out
with a large disorganized force of several thousand men
and swarms of camp followers. The rains had begun, and
progress was slow. On the 7th June he was face to face
with the rebels in a densely wooded country. A seriba
(or stockade of prickly shrubs) was commenced, and the
troops were formed up inside it in a hollow square. The
rebels, however, broke in upon them, and defeated and
utterly routed the whole force. This crushing defeat gave
a fresh impetus to the insurrection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13th June.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Despatch

<p>On the 13th June 400 men were sent by steamer to
reinforce the garrison of Fashoda, and on the 29th a battalion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
which had arrived at Kartoum from Senheit,<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> was also
sent on there. These reinforcements were placed under
the command of Rashid Pasha, whose orders had been
altered, and who had only accompanied the troops for
Kordofan as far as Tur-el-Hadra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Events in
Darfur.
17th June.</div>

<div class="sidenote">20th July.</div>

<p>News from Darfur was scant and unreliable. It was
rumoured that an attack on Omohangah on the 17th June
had been repulsed; but that towards Shaka an Egyptian
force of 1000 men had been almost annihilated on the
20th July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th June.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of

<p>In Kordofan the rebels attacked Bara<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> on the 28th June,
but were repulsed, it is said, with a loss of 32,000 men. At
the same time large bands infested the neighbourhood
El Obeyed, and water, fuel, and grain were already reported
to be scarce in that town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July.</div>

<p>Early in July the insurrection was rumoured to have
spread to the provinces of Bahr-el-Ghazel Shaka, and the
Equator, but the reports turned out to be exaggerated, and
the movement never obtained any hold in those parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">June and
July.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Formation
of slave
battalions.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<p>Towards the end of June the works of defence for the
protection of Kartoum were commenced to the south of
the town. It began to appear doubtful whether the irregular
troops would be able to make head against the
rebellion, and reinforcements from Cairo were not arriving.
It was then resolved to form negro battalions, and every
slave-owner in Kartoum was called upon to give up a
certain number of slaves for the purpose. By this means
it was estimated that 2000 troops could be obtained. The
same system had been followed two years before, during
the mobilization of the army for operations against Abyssinia.
It had the double advantage of increasing the troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
and diminishing the number of slaves, who it was feared
might revolt.</p>

<p>The foreign inhabitants, having no slaves, decided to give
assistance in kind, and sent 525 ardebs<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> of dhoora,<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> worth
360 pounds sterling, towards the sustenance of these newly
raised battalions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Proclamation
of a

Kartoum.</div>

<p>In August a state of siege was proclaimed in Kartoum.
Five forts had been constructed, each armed with one gun.
The town was divided into four military sections, and
pickets patrolled the streets both day and night. A rising
in the town was expected, simultaneously with an attack
from without.</p>

<p>As a further protection, it was decided to cut a canal
south of the town, joining the two branches of the Nile, but
the commencement of this work appears to have been delayed
till November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revolt
of the

tribe.</div>

<p>The Kababish Arabs, an important tribe occupying a
large tract of country between Kordofan and Dongola, were
in revolt, and a large force of them were menacingly encamped
within a day’s march of Kartoum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">July and
August.</div>

<p>During July and August many minor engagements were
fought upon the lines of communication between the White
Nile and Kordofan, which almost always resulted in favour
of the rebels. The commercial town of Shatt, on the road
from Duem, on the White Nile, to El Obeyed, was totally
destroyed by them, the male population was put to the
sword, and the women and children were carried off into
captivity.</p>

<p>In the beginning of August the insurgent forces were
divided into three principal groups:&mdash;</p>

August, and routed, leaving 3500 dead on the field of
battle.  This defeat frustrated the projected march on
Kartoum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advance

<p>After this the Mahdi took the field in person, and
advanced on El Obeyed, around which an earthen rampart,
armed with a few guns, had been thrown up. The garrison
consisted of 6000 men, armed with Remington rifles. The
rifles had been sent there in June by Abdel Kader Pasha,
in anticipation of a siege.</p>

<p>The rebels were armed with spears and matchlocks.</p>

<p>On the 8th of September the Mahdi made a desperate
assault on the town, but was repulsed with great slaughter,
his losses being reported to be from 12,000 to 15,000 killed,
while those of the garrison are put down at 288. Two
brothers of the Mahdi and several insurgent chiefs were
among the slain. The attack was repeated on the 11th
and 14th September, but on both occasions without success.
The rebels fought with the greatest fury, quite regardless
of death. Their losses in the three assaults are said to
have reached the enormous total of 40,000.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeal to
the loyalty
of the
Arabs, and

<p>In presence of the disaffection of many of the regular
troops, the Governor-General of the Soudan issued an appeal
to the patriotism of those of the Shukuriyeh, Dabaina,
and Kababish tribes who still remained loyal, urging them
to take the field against the rebels, and promising the remission
of one year’s taxes. He further undertook to pay
£2 for every dervish (as the followers of Mahdi were called)
captured, dead or alive, and £18 for every chief.</p>

<p>All booty was to remain the property of the captors.
The result was that shortly afterwards several thousand
volunteers joined the troops at Kawa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd September.</div>

<p>On the 3rd September, 300 negro recruits reached Kartoum
from Lardo in the Equatorial provinces, and these
were shortly followed by 1100 Bazingers, (untrained soldiers

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the Mahdi
near Bara.</div>

<p>A relief column of two battalions of regular troops and
850 Bashi Bazouks, altogether 3000 strong, under Ali Bey
Satfi, set out from Duem towards the end of September to
attempt to raise the siege of Bara.  It suffered terrible
privations on the way, the rebels having filled in all the
wells along the road between Abu Shoka and Bara (seven
days’ march).  The troops had almost nothing but the
juice of wild melons and dhoora stalks to quench their thirst.
They were continually harassed by the enemy, but were
not attacked in force till they approached El Kona, when
Ali Satfi Bey and all the senior officers were killed. The
losses of the Egyptians amounted to 1100, besides 1150
rifles and a large quantity of stores and ammunition. The
remainder of the troops were at length rallied by a captain,
and succeeded in driving off the enemy. They then continued
the march to Bara, and were met some distance
from the town by the garrison, which had come out to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
assistance. The Mahdi was then encamped at a water
station in the neighbourhood of Bara.  On the 25th
October the garrison made a sortie, and attacked and defeated
him, but subsequently retired within the entrenchments.</p>

<p>After the repulses at El Obeyed and Bara, the Mahdi
was deserted by many of his followers, and his forces in
Kordofan appear to have been quite shattered for the
time. So much was the danger for Kordofan thought to
be over, that, when the Mudir of Darfur appeared at
Omchanga about the end of October with a considerable
armed force, his proffered assistance was declined.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Demand
for reinforcements
from
Cairo.</div>

<p>A report having reached Kartoum that the above-mentioned
relief column had been totally destroyed, the
Governor-General telegraphed to Cairo that he must have
reinforcements of at least 10,000 men. He stated that
without a large force at his disposal the insurrection would
spread through all parts of the Soudan, and that then the
pacification of the country would require an army of at
least four times the strength of that for which he asked.</p>

<p class="p2">During Arabi’s short tenure of power, he had but little
time to devote to the affairs of the Soudan, and no reinforcements
were sent there; in fact, orders were actually
given for some of the troops to be withdrawn from there
to Egypt to assist in the war against the English.</p>

<p>After the occupation of Cairo, the suppression of the
rebellion in the Soudan was one of the first questions to
occupy the attention of the Government of the Khedive.
Various plans were suggested, and it was at length decided,
after the receipt of the previously-mentioned telegram from
Abdel Kader Pasha, to enlist about 10,000 officers and
men who had fought under Arabi for service in the
Soudan. At the request of the Khedive several English
officers were appointed to the staff of this force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">November.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Despatch
of reinforcements
to the
Soudan.</div>

<p>By the beginning of November between two and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
thousand troops had already been concentrated at the
“Barrage” on the Nile near Cairo, and were being
equipped for the expedition.</p>

<p>The first detachment, one thousand strong, left Suez for
Suakin, whence they were to march to Berber on the
14th November.</p>

<p>Desertions from the depôt at the “Barrage” were very
frequent. They were due to a rumour among the soldiers
that they were to be transported to the Soudan as prisoners.
The arms and ammunition required for the expedition
were forwarded to Suakin, separately from the troops, as a
measure of precaution.</p>

<p>On the 12th December 1500 troops left Cairo for the
Soudan, bringing up the total contingent already sent to
5000.</p>

<p>Thanks to the energy of Al-ed-Deen Pasha, Governor of
the Red Sea provinces, steps were taken at Suakin for the
speedy despatch of the reinforcements as soon as they
arrived from Suez. No delays occurred, the necessary
supply of camels for the transport of baggage and stores
having always been prepared beforehand. Throughout
the revolt of Arabi, Al-ed-Deen Pasha had remained loyal,
and had inspired such respect for the Khedive that even
natives, who may have entertained sympathy with the
rebellious movement, did not dare to commit any overt act
of hostility, and thus public order and tranquillity were
never for a moment disturbed in the provinces over which
he was Governor.</p>

<p>By the 9th January, 1883, the arrivals of soldiers at the
depôt at the “Barrage” had reached 9500. The departures
were already 7700. They included 100 dismounted
cavalry, 100 gunners, and nine battalions of infantry,
formed into three regiments. The 1st Battalion of the
4th Regiment was on the point of leaving.</p>

<p>By the middle of February the last of these reinforcements
for the Soudan had left Egypt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Construction
of a
canal
south of

<p>On the 15th November the long projected canal south
of Kartoum was commenced, eight hundred to a thousand
yards in front of the town. Its dimensions are as follow:
length, when the rivers are in flood, 5900 yards; when at
low water, 6700; depth of ditch, 8 feet; width at top,
17 feet; at bottom, 10 feet; slopes steep; width of parapet
at bottom, 20 feet; at top, 14 feet; height, 7 feet. The
principal defects of the parapet are its great length, and
the absence of flanking defence. The idea of constructing
a defensive canal, and turning Kartoum into an island,
originated with Musa Pasha in 1864.</p>

<div class="sidenote">December.</div>

<div class="sidenote">State of
the garrisons
of
El Obeyed
and Bara.</div>

<p>The garrison of El Obeyed was reported to be still fairly
well supplied with food on the 12th December, and to be in
good spirits. A few days previously it had sallied out and
attacked Sheikh Mennoo, the leading rebel chief in the
neighbourhood, killing about 70 of his people.</p>

<p>At Bara,<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> the garrison was badly off for food, and in a
depressed condition. Some of the irregular officers with
their men had deserted to the rebels. The Mahdi, with
the bulk of his forces, was encamped round the town. His
ranks had been much thinned by desertion and sickness,
but, on the other hand, he was gaining fresh adherents every
day. For the moment he had ceased to take the offensive,
and was contenting himself with blockading Bara and El
Obeyed, while the Makashef operated with a large force on
the Nile.</p>

<p>Darfur was so far quiet, though the Mahdi was reported
to be doing his utmost to stir up the tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of

<p>On the 16th December, Lieut.-Colonel Stewart, of the
11th Hussars, arrived at Kartoum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1882.</div>

<p>Owing to the absence of any trustworthy information, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
had been sent by the British Government to inquire into
the true state of affairs in the Soudan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">December.</div>

<p>Two battalions of reinforcements from Egypt (the 1st
and 2nd Battalions, 1st Regiment) reached Kartoum early
in December, and formed a camp at Omdurman on the left
bank of the Nile, opposite Kartoum.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after their arrival there were rumours
of fresh outbreak in the neighbourhood of Kawa, and later
on, in those of Sennaar and Mesalamieh on the Blue Nile.
Instead of forming a relief column for Kordofan, it was
deemed necessary to employ these battalions first in restoring
order on the banks of the Blue and White Niles. The
1st battalion was sent to Shawal on the White Nile, and on
the evening of the 30th December the 2nd battalion left by
steamer for Mesalamieh.</p>

<p>The Makashef, with a large force, was at Sibel threatening
Sennaar, and was causing a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>Abdel Kader Pasha gave orders for four companies at
Sennaar and the garrison of irregulars at Abut (immediately
north of Sibel) to make a combined attack on the last-mentioned
place. It was to support this attack, which was
ordered for the 4th January, that the 2nd Battalion 1st
Regiment was sent to Mesalamieh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">31st December.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Repulse

<p>The attack was, however, anticipated by the Makashef,

in interrupting all communication between Mesalamieh
and Sennaar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1st and

<p>On the 1st January the four companies at Sennaar left

<div class="sidenote">January.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reinforcements
from
Egypt.</div>

<p>By the beginning of January the undermentioned reinforcements
had arrived from Egypt, viz.: infantry, 5 battalions
(4170 men); artillery, 180 men, with 10 mountain
guns and 10 rocket troughs; cavalry, 97 Circassians clad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
in chain armour. A few mules had accompanied the
artillery, but there were no horses with the cavalry. With
the exception of the two battalions, which had gone to
Shawal and Mesalamieh, the whole of this force was
encamped at Omdurman, near Kartoum. The troops were
working at elementary drill and tactics, and making some
progress, but the officers were, as a rule, ignorant, and
incapable of grasping the meaning of the simplest movement,
unwilling to assume any responsibility, and totally
devoid of initiative.</p>

<p>Many of the troops had superstitious ideas regarding the
power of the Mahdi, and others thought that the Khedive
had only sent them to the Soudan to get rid of them.</p>

<p>They were dressed in long white cotton shirts and native
cotton trousers. Most of them wore coarse leather sandals.
Each man had a grey overcoat and hood. The infantry
were all armed with Remington rifles.</p>

<p>The tactics of the Egyptians in the presence of the
enemy were to form battalion or double company squares.
The troops were formed in three ranks, to give them confidence.
Each man was provided with four or five crow’s
feet (iron spikes with four points), which he was instructed
to throw in front of him on the approach of the enemy.
The rebels usually attacked in several masses.</p>

<p>Early in January news was received of a disaster on the

had been sent from the fort of Jura Hadra in a northerly
direction to repair the line of telegraph to Kartoum. When
a short distance from the fort, they were attacked by some
rebels under Fakir Owde.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The troops formed square as
usual, but after a short resistance commenced to give way,
the square was broken, and many were killed. Half the
party, however, managed to rally, and held out until a
reinforcement came to their assistance from Jura Hadra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.

January.</div>

<p>On the 2nd January, Abdel Kader Pasha left Kartoum
by steamer to take personal command of the troops operating
between the Blue and White Niles. He did not reach
Mesalamieh till the 7th, having stopped frequently on the
journey to interview the chiefs of the villages on the banks
of the river.</p>

<p>The town of Mesalamieh is six miles west of the river.
On arrival, the Pasha proceeded immediately to inspect the
battalion encamped there (2nd Battalion, 1st Regiment),
and informed the officers that he intended to march with
as small a baggage train as possible. They protested, and
made all kinds of difficulties, but it was finally decided
that each company should be accompanied by four camels
only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">8th
January.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Advance
on Abut.</div>

<p>On the 8th January, the battalion, with some irregular
troops under Saliha Bey, and some Shukuriyeh horsemen,
started for Abut. The order of march was in company
column with scouts on both flanks, and advance and rear
guards. The country traversed was a treeless but well-cultivated
open plain, with many villages and plenty of
water. The crops consisted chiefly of dhoora (maize) and
cotton. There were also many large herds of cattle, and
flocks of sheep. The inhabitants were very friendly, and
freely supplied the troops with water, and even with bread.</p>

<p>At 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, a halt was made at the Faulla (pond) of El-Sunga.
The troops bivouacked, protected by a bank which
had, on a previous occasion, been thrown up round the
pond. Ten men per company were employed to patrol
during the night some 500 yards from the camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th
January.</div>

<p>On the 9th, the column started at 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The order of
march was the same as on the preceding day. Two miles
from the bivouac, the village of Effena was passed. This
was the last inhabited village met with on the road.
Further on they were all deserted, the inhabitants having
gone off willingly, or unwillingly, to join the rebels, leaving
their crops standing, and ready for harvesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>At 1.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the village of Abut was reached. It is a
small military station, and had a garrison of 350 men, who
were encamped in a zeriba with trench near the well.
When attacked on the 31st December, only 150 of the
garrison were present, 200 men under Osman Agha had
arrived since then. Two new zeribas were at once constructed,
one for the regular troops, and another for the
irregulars. Reconnaissances were pushed in all directions,
but especially along the roads leading to Kawa <i>viâ</i> Waliya,
and to Manasra, south of Sibel.</p>

<p>Finding then that the quelling of the insurrection in the
province of Sennaar would be a more difficult task than he
had anticipated, the Pasha determined to call up the
battalion from Shawal,<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> and to send for another from
Kartoum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">10th
January.</div>

<p>The 3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment, left Kartoum accordingly
on the afternoon of the 10th January, and proceeded up
the Blue Nile in twelve sailing boats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">11th
January.</div>

<p>On the 11th January, Abdel Kader was still at Abut.
On that date his attention was to await the arrival of the
3rd Battalion, and then march on Sennaar. Reports had
come in that that town was hard pressed by a large body
of rebels, that Karkoj was again in their hands, that the
tribe of Rufaa el Sherk,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> under Sheikh Sherif el Hindi,
was in full revolt, and the last mentioned was doing his
best to induce Aud el Kerim Bey, the powerful Sheikh of
the Shukuriyeh, to join the movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">12th
January.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 12th, however, it was reported that the Sheikh
Wad el Kerif, at the head of a large force, was marching
from Maatuk to attack Abdel Kader, that he was forcing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
all the men of the districts through which he passed to join
him, and that Fakir Moosa, who was commanding the
rebels in the neighbourhood of Kawa, would co-operate
with him.</p>

<p>This news compelled the Pasha to reconsider his decision,
and, instead of advancing on Sennaar, he resolved to await
the approach of the Wad el Kerif.</p>

<p>On the White Nile, the Hassaniyeh nomads were again

neighbourhood of Karasah,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> the 1st Battalion, 2nd Regiment,
left Kartoum on the 16th January in two steamers, and proceeded
up the White Nile. It was accompanied by the
Vakeel<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> of the Mudiriyeh and some Ulemas. These officials
were directed to enter into communication with the
people, and to try to induce them to submit quietly. The
orders given to the battalion were to disembark when still
a little north of the village, and then advance in close
order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th
January.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat
of the
Egyptians
at Karasah.</div>

<p>On the 18th, the steamers reached the neighbourhood of
the village. Here one of the steamers ran aground in the
middle of the river. The other, on board of which was the
Bimbashi<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> with five companies, pushed up right abreast of
the village. Three companies immediately disembarked,
lined a low sand dyke parallel to and about 500 yards from
the river, and opened fire on some rebels who were about
2000 yards off. The latter advanced to the attack, but the
severity of the fire forced them to incline away to the right
and left as they approached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>Three or four horsemen of the right-hand party succeeded
in penetrating between the dyke and the river, and fell
upon the two companies which had disembarked last, and
were not yet formed up. This was the signal for a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
panic, and the flight of all the Egyptians to the river. The
rebels did not pursue. In the confusion the Bimbashi was
killed, some accounts say by his own men, others by the
enemy.</p>

<p>The other steamer with the three remaining companies
of the battalion having by this time come up, a council of
war was held, when it was decided that the battalion was
not strong enough to advance, and that reinforcements of
men and guns from Kartoum were absolutely necessary.
The rebel force did not in reality exceed 400 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">26th
January.</div>

<p>During the next few days the battalion remained quietly
on board the steamers off Karasah. On the 26th January,
the Bimbashi of the 2nd battalion of the regiment arrived
from Kartoum to replace the Bimbashi who had been
killed. The steamers were then lying about two and a half
hours’ march from the village. An advance was ordered
for 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the 27th so as to attack the village at daybreak,
and take the rebels by surprise. But, on the
remonstrances of nearly all the officers, who said that they
would certainly be killed if they marched in the dark
through an unknown country, the order was cancelled, and
that day nothing was done except a short reconnaissance
inland. The Bimbashi, however, decided to attack on the
28th. After the orders were issued five of the senior
officers proceeded to report themselves sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th
January.</div>

<p>At 3.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the 28th the battalion marched off. It
was formed up in a square, preceded by an advance guard
and scouts, and at daybreak was within about 800 yards of
the village, from which it was separated by a long, narrow
strip of forest.</p>

<p>Two companies were ordered into the forest to reconnoitre
the path leading to the village, but the officers refused
to advance, saying that they and their men would certainly
be killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>During the delay and discussion that followed, some
soldiers, disobeying orders, fired at some cattle that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
grazing near by. This gave the alarm to the rebels, and
in a few minutes nine or ten horsemen appeared at the edge
of the wood. By galloping about and waving their swords,
these men engaged the attention of the troops, and gave
time for the removal of the women and cattle from the
village. When this was accomplished, the rebel foot advanced
through the wood, and the troops immediately began
to fall back. The rebels, who did not exceed 350, and had
no firearms, followed them till within about half an hour’s
distance of the steamer, but generally keeping out of rifle
range. It is estimated that about thirty of them were
killed or wounded. A few hours after the return of the
troops to the boats, the 2nd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment,
as well as two guns and a rocket trough, arrived from Kartoum
with the Kaimakan<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> of the regiment. These reinforcements
had been sent on receipt of a direct order from
the Khedive.</p>

<p>The rebels appear to have been subsequently attacked
and defeated, but there does not appear to be any account
of the engagement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th
January.</div>

<p>The 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment, and 225 Bashi Bazouks,
without horses, arrived at Kartoum from Egypt on the 24th
January. 650 camels for transport purposes had already
been collected at Kartoum, and 400 were expected in a few
days from Dongola. According to the lowest estimate,
300 camels per battalion would be required for the
Kordofan expedition, to be distributed as follows:&mdash;For
rations, 115; water, 75; ammunition, 52; officers, 25; sick
hospital, &amp;c., 33.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 23rd January, Hussein Pasha Serri, the senior
military officer at Kartoum, received a telegram from the
Khedive ordering him to suspend all operations and to concentrate
all the troops at Kartoum, pending the arrival of
some English staff officers at Cairo.  The fact of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Khedive communicating direct with this officer instead of
with Giegler Pasha, the representative of Abdel Kader,
caused a great deal of unpleasantness. This order was
communicated to Abdel Kader, then at Abut, who replied
that, if he withdrew the troops to Kartoum the rebellion
would unquestionably extend in the eastern provinces, and
that, if the expedition did not soon leave for Kordofan,
that province would be lost, and with it Darfur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th
January.</div>

<p>To return to the operations of Abdel Kader. About the
24th January a party of rebels pillaged the village of Mangalla,
which, together with some others of the south and
south-west of Abut, had submitted to the Government of
the Khedive.</p>

<p>Hearing of this, the Pasha, having been joined by the
3rd Battalion, 1st Regiment, determined to advance against
a large body of rebels, reported to be about eight hours’
march from his camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the rebels
near
Maatuk.</div>

<p>Early on the 27th he moved towards the village of
Maatuk. When about three hours from it, the rebels were
observed on a plain on the further side of a small wood.
The troops were at once halted in the open, about 500
yards from the wood, and formed into square.</p>

<p>The rebels, after a short halt for prayer, advanced
through the wood, but, contrary to expectation, halted
again at the near edge, and Wad Eyoub, a revolted Benluk
Bashi of irregulars, with some negroes, opened fire on the
troops, killing one and wounding five. The square then
fired, and after some minutes the rebels commenced to
retire, pursued by the irregular cavalry. In this affair
Faki Moosa was wounded. The losses of the rebels are
estimated at 600 killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>In the retreat the rebels broke up into two parties, one,
under Sheikh Wad-el-Kerif, went in a south-westerly
direction towards Göz Abu Djuma,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and the other, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
Faki Moosa and Faki Mohammed Abu Shneb, retired to
the village of Baatuk on the road to Kawa.</p>

<div class="sidenote">28th

<p>Against the latter, the Pasha directed the whole of his
available cavalry and camel corps, altogether about 300
men. This force came up with the rebels at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the
28th, and totally defeated them, killing Abu Shneb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st February.</div>

<p>On the 1st February Abdel-Kader, with his two battalions,
reached Kawa, where he met the 1st Battalion, 1st
Regiment, from Shawal. On the 3rd February this force
was increased by the arrival of the 1st and 2nd battalions
2nd Regiment, which had marched along the river bank
from Karasah, performing, according to their own account,
prodigies of valour on the road.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3rd February.</div>

<p>On the 3rd February Abdel-Kader left Kawa by
steamer for Kartoum leaving orders&mdash;</p>

<p class="phang p1">(1.) That the three battalions of the 1st Regiment were
to march at once to Wad el Medinet on the Blue
Nile, where he would join them about the 15th for
an advance on Sennaar; and</p>

<p class="phang">(2.) That the two battalions of the 2nd Regiment, under
the Kaimakan, were to attack the rebels at Abu
Djuma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disaffection

<p class="p1">Towards the end of January it was rumoured in Kartoum
that the Kababish Arabs had gone over to the
Mahdi, or rather to the Faki Manne, who commanded
the rebels in Northern Kordofan. As the Kababish extend
as far north as Dongola, fears were entertained that the
rebellion might spread to that province, and early in
February it was reported that the natives about Debbeh<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
were becoming very restless. Some Bashi Bazouks were
sent there to maintain order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender
of Bara,
5th
January.</div>

<p>On the 11th February, a messenger arrived at Kartoum
from the west confirming the rumours that Bara had fallen
on the 5th January. The garrison were said to be fairly well
treated by the Arabs, and only the officers were kept in
confinement.  By this surrender 2000 troops, besides a
considerable quantity of arms and ammunition, fell into the
hands of the rebels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of El
Obeyed.</div>

<p>Four days afterwards the news arrived that El Obeyed
had capitulated on the 17th January, and that the whole of
Kordofan was in the hands of the Mahdi.</p>

<p>After the repulse of the assaults on El Obeyed, in September,
1882, various plans were proposed for attacking
the Mahdi, but the Council of War was always of opinion
that the troops available were too few, and the garrison
relapsed into a state of inactivity, which continued, so far
as any operations of importance are concerned, till the end
of the siege. Small sorties of two or three hundred men
were, however, of frequent occurrence, generally resulting
in the capture of some cattle and grain.</p>

<p>The besiegers, on their side, established themselves comfortably
around the town, some availing themselves of the
ruined houses, and others building straw huts, and patiently
awaited the inevitable surrender.</p>

<p>Such was the attitude taken up by both sides till the
13th January, by which date the supply of food was almost
exhausted, and everything eatable was being sold at
fabulous prices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 14th, the Mahdi sent letters to Mahmoud Said,
the Governor of the Western Soudan, and all the principal
officers, telling them that they had held out long enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
and, if they would surrender, he would guarantee the safety
of their lives. On the 16th, a party of rebels appeared
outside the entrenchments to open negociations for a capitulation.
Mahmoud Said Pasha was not present at the
interview which followed, but the greater part of the
garrison appear to have agreed to the terms that were
proposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">17th
January.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Surrender
of El
Obeyed.</div>

<p>During the night many of the garrison deserted. At
daybreak on the 17th the insurgents advanced against the
town in force. The Pasha ordered what remained of the
garrison to fire, but the infantry refused to do so, and
passed over to the enemy, while the artillery fired a few
salvoes in a direction that could do no harm to the assailing
force. The Pasha then understood that he was completely
abandoned by his men, and consented to surrender
and make submission to the Mahdi, who was then at an
hour and a half’s distance from the town.</p>

<p>On entering the town, the Mahdi proceeded immediately
to the principal mosque.</p>

<p>Mahmoud Said Pasha, and Ali Sherif Bey, the Mudir of
Kordofan, were at first treated with consideration, but, on
their refusal to give up their money they were seized and
imprisoned. 8000<i>l.</i> sterling in gold was found concealed
in the house of the former, and 7000<i>l.</i> in that of the latter.</p>

<p class="p2">Altogether, although little or no money was found in
the public treasury, the Mahdi is said to have taken more
than 100,000<i>l.</i> from the officials and notables. He kept all
the booty for himself, and distributed none of it among his
followers. This was a source of great dissatisfaction, and
subsequently caused many to waver in their allegiance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>The garrison at the time of the surrender numbered
about 3500. They were made to swear fidelity to the
Mahdi, enlisted in his service, and told off by companies to
the various banners. About 6000 Remington rifles, five
guns, and one rocket trough passed into the hands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
rebels. As regards provisions, only 200 ardebs<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> of dhoora
were found in the town. Towards the end of the siege
famine had prevailed, and the inhabitants had kept themselves
alive by chewing raw india-rubber, varied with
a small ration of dhoora.</p>

<p>All the books and Government papers were destroyed
and the town was completely looted.</p>

<p>The Mahdi took up his residence in the Government
House, and appointed a Governor of the town, but did not
make any attempt to form a regular administration. The
following is a translation of a proclamation issued by
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proclamation
issued
by the
Mahdi.</div>

<p>“From the servant of his Lord Mohammed el Mahdi,
son of Said Abdallah, to all the fervent proselytes.</p>

<p>“We have appointed as your Prince our dear Sheik
Mansour, son of Abd el hakem. Execute his orders and
commands, and follow him in the path of battle.</p>

<p>“He who submits to him submits to us; he who disobeys
him disobeys us, and disobeys God Himself and His Prophet.
Let all show penitence before God, and abandon all bad and
forbidden habits, such as the degrading acts of the flesh,
the use of wine and tobacco, lying, bearing false witness,
disobedience to parents, brigandage, the non-restitution of
goods to others, the clapping of hands, dancing, improper
signs with the eyes, tears and lamentations at the bed of
the dead, slanderous language, calumny, and the company
of strange women. Clothe your women in a decent way,
and let them be careful not to speak to unknown persons.
All those who do not pay attention to these principles
disobey God and His Prophet, and they shall be punished
in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>“Say your prayers at the prescribed hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>“Give the tenth part of your goods, handing it to our
Prince, Sheikh Mansour, in order that he may forward it to
the treasury of Islam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
“Adore God, and hate not each other, but assist each
other to do good.”</p>

<p>At the bottom of this, the seal of the Mahdi was affixed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">13th

<div class="sidenote">Advance
of Abdel
Kader
towards
Sennaar.</div>

<p class="p2">On the 13th February, Abdel Kader Pasha left Kartoum
to rejoin the troops at Wad of Medinet, who had marched
from Kawa. He proceeded thence towards Sennaar, his
force consisting of the three battalions of the 1st Regiment,
about 600 Bashi Bazouks, some Sakkeyer horsemen, and a
few guns and rocket troughs.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd February he reached Meshoa-el-Dakhin,
about eight hours’ march from Sennaar. That evening,
about 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, a large body of rebels under the Makashef,
who had raised the siege of Sennaar, approached the camp.
Some shots were exchanged, but the rebels, finding the
soldiers on the alert, retired. The following day, Friday,
a halt was made, and the neighbourhood was thoroughly
reconnoitred. Abdel Kader received a letter from the Makashef,
in which, after testifying to the divine mission
and the invincibility of the Mahdi, he invited the Pasha to
submit, saying that he had a regard for him, and was
anxious to spare his life and spiritual hereafter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th
February.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the rebels
at Meshra-el-Dai.</div>

<p>Early on the 24th, the march was continued. On
approaching Meshra-el-Dai, the Makashef was discovered
with 10,000 or 12,000 followers in some bushy ground close
to the river. The guns and rockets at once opened fire on
them. After some time the rebels came out into the open
and attacked the troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>They advanced with great determination, but after a
severe fight were dispersed and pursued by the Cavalry;
the engagement lasted from 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> till 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Of the
troops 27 were wounded. The rebel loss was estimated at
2000 killed, including Sheikh Woad el Kerif, of Maatuk
notoriety. Many of the rebels fled into the river, where
they were cut down by the cavalry. The Makashef succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
in escaping. Some of the rebels used firearms, and
Abdel Kader had a narrow escape, his watch-chain being
broken by a bullet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">25th
February.</div>

<p>Saturday night the troops remained halted, but on
Sunday the 25th the march was continued to Sennaar.
The inhabitants of the villages along the road came in, and
tendered their submission.</p>

<p>The route between Sennaar and Kartoum, both by land
and water, was reported to be safe. A regular postal
service was immediately reestablished, and steps were
taken for repairing the line of telegraph.</p>

<p>After the defeat at Meshra-el-Dai on the 24th, the
insurgents appear to have split themselves up into three
bodies; one under Abdul Ghaffar retired to Karkoj and
joined Faki Sherif, another under the Makashef took up a
position at Jebel Sekhédy, about six hours west of Sennaar,
and a third came into Sennaar and gave themselves up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4th March.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of

<p>Abdel Kader’s scouts having brought in intelligence of
the Makashef’s whereabouts, a force of 1200 irregulars,
made up of Shukuriyeh and Aburoff Arabs, under Saleh
Agha, was directed against him.  An engagement took
place on the 4th March at Sekhédy, which resulted in the
total defeat of the rebels, who lost 547 killed, among whom
were Sheikhs Omr and Amr, brothers of the Makashef, and
Sadyk, his nephew. The casualties among Saleh Agha’s
force were only two men wounded.</p>

<p>Abdel Kader then proposed marching south up the
Blue Nile, and pacifying the country as far as Karkoj, after
which he intended to cross the river, and advance eastward
against the revolted Rufaa-el-Sherk and Kawakli tribes in
the country between the rivers Dinder and Rahad. But,
as will be seen further on, he was superseded before he had
time to carry out these plans.</p>

Surgeon-Major Rosenberg.</p>

<p>Colonel Hicks had been appointed Chief of the Staff of
the Army of the Soudan, with local rank of Major-General,
but it was intended that he should direct, and be responsible
for, all preparations and operations&mdash;in fact, that he should
in reality be the Commander-in-Chief, while nominally
holding a subordinate post.</p>

<p>The Mahdi’s movement being, at any rate ostensibly, a
religious one, it was deemed inadvisable to place at the
head of the Egyptian Army of the Soudan a foreigner and
a non-Mussulman, lest the insurgent leader might make
capital out of this to arouse still further the fanaticism of
his followers.</p>

<p>Suleiman Nyasi, whose military career dates back to the
days of Mahomet Ali and the Crimean War, was consequently
named to the chief command, but on the understanding
that he was to pay strict attention to, and carefully
follow out General Hicks’s instructions and plans, but his
indolence, apathy, ignorance, and in many instances apparent
malignity and jealousy, caused him frequently to
act in anything but the spirit of the instructions given him
at Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">18th

<p>On the 18th March, Major Farquhar, who had been on a
reconnaissance up the White Nile, returned to Kartoum.
He reported the inhabitants along the western bank of
the river to be hostile.</p>

<p>Four thousand five hundred rebels and 1800 Baggara
Arab Cavalry were assembled about Marabieh and Abu
Djuma, and at Jebel Ain there was a considerable body,
which had lately been reinforced from Kordofan. The
Baggaras had quarrelled with the Mahdi regarding the
booty taken at El Obeyed, and had seized and carried off
some of it. The troops at the posts along the river were in
rags, and from four to six months in arrears of pay.</p>

<p>News from Kordofan stated that the Mahdi’s force was
about one hundred thousand strong, that it had dispersed
for the moment, but could be quickly reassembled. The
chiefs met at El Obeyed every Friday for orders, but the
Sheiks of the Baggara did not attend.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this discontent, General Hicks was
trying to open communications with the last-mentioned,

Reconnaissance
up the

Nile.</div>

<p class="p1">On the 10th April General Hicks made a reconnaissance
up the river. He started at 6 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the steamer <i>Bordeen</i>,
taking with him one mountain gun, two Nordenfeldts, and
50 Bashi-Bazouks. After proceeding for about an hour
and a-half, the steamer was fired on from the western bank.
Higher up shots were fired from many places, especially
opposite the island of Abba, where the rebels had constructed
trenches along the banks. But a few shells, and
some rounds from the Nordenfeldts and rifles, soon drove
them inland. Owing to the failure of fuel, the reconnaissance
could not be continued as far as the ford of Abu-Zed.
The steamer returned to Kawa at 5.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 14th April, General Hicks telegraphed to Cairo
that he was anxious to get to Jebel-Ain (eight marches
distant), where the rebels were concentrating, as soon as
possible, but that his supplies were insufficient as he had
only enough for from 15 to 20 days with him, and nothing
was obtainable in the country. The administration of the
army was most difficult, owing to the want of proper
departments, and the troops were several months in arrears
of pay. The steamers were out of repair, and too few in
number to do all that was required of them&mdash;viz., to bring
up supplies of ammunition and food, take possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
ford at Abu-Zed, and patrol the river and stop communication
between the banks. There was no store of fuel, all
had to be cut as required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23rd
April.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Seizure of
the ford of
Abu-zed.</div>

<p>It was not till the 23rd April that the main body, nearly
5000 strong, set out from Kawa. Owing to the difficulty
of obtaining reliable information, General Hicks himself
with a small force had proceeded up the river on the 22nd
to reconnoitre, and seize the ford of Abu-Zed. On arrival
at the ford, it was found to be in possession of a small
body of rebels, who were driven off without much difficulty.
General Hicks remained there on the 23rd, placing
boats containing Bashi Bazouks under the command of
Jahier Bey, in échelon across the stream, in which position
they could command a very considerable length of the
ford (which extends about a mile), and support one
another in case of any attempt to force the passage.</p>

<p>He left on the morning of the 24th to continue the reconnaissance
up the river. The banks were found to be
occupied by straggling groups of Arabs, with whom shots
were exchanged.</p>

<p>On the 25th, the Chief of the Shilluk village of Musran
reported that the rebels had left Jebel-Ain and were
marching in force under the Makashef to attack the
“Turks” on the march from Kawa.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that this information was correct
General Hicks steamed back to the ford, warned Jahier
Bey, and, during the night, dropped down the river to join
the army, which was then encamped opposite the northern
end of the island of Abba.</p>

<p>Being in a favourable position, it remained halted on the
26th and 27th in expectation of an attack. On the former
date some rebel cavalry appeared, but were driven back
with a few shells, and on the night of the 27th there were
several false alarms. The march was resumed on the 28th.
On the following day tents were struck as usual, at daybreak,
and the order was given to march at seven <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span><span class="smcap">a.m.</span>

in front, reported that the enemy was about two
miles off, and advancing at a rapid pace. About a quarter
of an hour afterwards they appeared in considerable numbers,
both cavalry and infantry, and spread out towards the
flanks with a view of attacking the angles of the square in
which the Egyptian troops were formed.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>They then advanced quickly, led by chieftains on horseback
with banners borne in front of them. There was
considerable delay in getting the guns into action,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> but the
rebel cavalry broke as soon as the shells commenced falling
among them, and moved off the field. The infantry still
came on boldly, and, although shot down in numbers,
succeeded in getting close enough to the square to throw
some spears into it. But few of the enemy were armed
with rifles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883</div>

<p>After half an hour’s fighting, during which the Egyptian
troops behaved steadily and well, though they appeared to
have fired too high,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> the rebel force was completely broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
up, and fled in confusion. Owing to the absence of
cavalry, the pursuit was not as vigorous as it would otherwise
have been. The strength of the rebels exceeded
5000 men. Their losses in killed and wounded were about
500. The Makashef, his son, and several chiefs were
among the slain.</p>

immediate attempt would be made by the rebels to cross
to the western bank of the river at some point above the
ford of Abu-Zed, embarked on board the steamer <i>Bordeen</i>
at Gozabonne-Gomme, and proceeded up the river, taking
with him two Nordenfeldt guns, a rifled howitzer, and
150 Bashi Bazouks. At the ford of Abu-Zed he picked
up the steamer <i>Fascher</i>, with Jahier Bey and 90 Bashi
Bazouks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1st May.</div>

<p>On the 1st of May, the rebels were found to be crossing
in large numbers at a regular place of passage, about
10 miles below Jebel Ain. They were driven inland from
both banks with some loss. Numbers had already crossed,
but a large body with camels and baggage still remained
on the eastern bank. In the hope of capturing these,
General Hicks sent to Sulieman Pasha asking him to
hurry on as fast as possible. But the Egyptians had no
cavalry, and the infantry marched so slowly that it took
them more than two days to accomplish the twelve miles
between their camp and the place of passage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883</div>

<p>General Hicks himself went towards Jebel Ain, landed,
and sent a party up the mountain. On their return they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
stated that not a sign of a rebel was to be seen, and the
Shilluks also reported that the district had been evacuated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 3rd.</div>

<p>On the 3rd May General Hicks rejoined the main body,
then encamped near Jebel Ain. Suleiman Pasha was
anxious to march through the district, as he was of opinion
that there were several tribes in the neighbourhood to
whom it was of importance to show the army. But it was
finally decided to return to Duem at once, and prepare for
an attack on Schatt, where the rebels were reported to be
assembling in large numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral
effect of
the victory
at Marabiyeh.</div>

<p>The victory of the 29th had a very great moral effect
and many of the Baggara and other chiefs subsequently
surrendered. General Hicks, unaccompanied by any troops,
received several of them on the western bank of the river,
and thus gave confidence. Negotiations with the Kababish
Arabs were also in progress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Withdrawal
of
the army to
Kartoum.</div>

<p>Towards the end of May the rebels, who had been
threatening Duem, dispersed, and it was reported that the
western bank of the river was free from hostile bands.
The main body of the army was then withdrawn to
Kartoum, leaving garrisons at Kawa and Duem. On the
Blue Nile, Sennaar and Wod-Medinet were garrisoned.</p>

<p>The expedition to Kordofan could not be undertaken
till after the rains, when the wells in the desert would be
full, and pools of water would have been formed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Estimate
of the
expenses

<p>On the 15th May, the Governor-General of the Soudan
telegraphed to Cairo that he had only £40,000 in the
treasury at Kartoum, and that he thought it inadvisable to
enforce the taxes for fear of producing further disaffection
among the natives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>Arrears to the amount of £81,000 were still owing in the
Mudiriyehs of Kartoum and Sennaar for pay, food, and
transport. He was anxious that in future all salaries
should be paid punctually both to the officials and to the
military, and that the Government should be able to meet
its other expenses at the proper time. He requested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
large sums of money might be forwarded to him, and estimated
at £46,000 his monthly expenditure for the troops
at Kartoum, Sennaar, the military posts on the White and
Blue Niles, Fashoda, the Equatorial Provinces, and Bahr-Gazelle,
but exclusive of those at Dongola, Berber, and
in the Red Sea Provinces.</p>

<p>Reinforcements to the number of 3000 men were to be

<div class="sidenote">Removal
of Suleiman
Pasha
from the
command
of the
army of
the
Soudan.</div>

<p>On the 13th May General Hicks telegraphed to Cairo
requesting that he might be put in indisputable command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
of the army, as otherwise he could not be responsible for
the success of the expedition to Kordofan. It was subsequently
rumoured on several occasions that he had requested
to be relieved of his post on account of the systematic
obstructions he met with from native officials. These
reports were always officially contradicted. However, on
the 2nd August, Reuter’s agent at Alexandria announced
that the Governor-General of the Soudan had been appointed
to command the troops in that province, and that Suleiman
Pasha had been recalled, and appointed Governor of the
Red Sea Provinces. By this means it was expected that
General Hicks would regain complete liberty of action,
though Al-ed-Deen Pasha was to accompany the expedition
to Kordofan.</p>

<p>During the absence of the latter, Hussein Bey, Lieutenant-colonel
of the 2nd Regiment, was to act as his
deputy at Kartoum. Rashid Pasha, who was then Governor
of the Red Sea Provinces, was to be given the command
of one of the brigades of the Expeditionary Force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Position of
The Mahdi.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>The Mahdi only remained master of Kordofan. All
reports from there tended to show that serious dissensions
had broken out between him and his chiefs, and that the
number of his adherents was daily diminishing. His position
appeared to be getting critical. From the north he
was threatened by the Egyptian army, and to the east the
White Nile, which was constantly patrolled by Egyptian
boats, would bar any attempt at escape in that direction.
On the south King Adam of Takallé had sworn to kill the
Mahdi if he attempted to pass through his country to Jebel
Gedir, whither he had sent his family and most of the booty
captured at El Obeyed. King Adam was also taking steps
to arrange with Sheikh Asaker, chief of the Baggara Gimeh
Arabs, inhabiting the desert from the island of Abba towards
Takallé, a joint offensive movement against southern
Kordofan. In the middle of July it was stated that the
Mahdi had given up all hopes of resistance, and was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
anxious about his personal safety; and that it was his intention
to try to reach the copper mines in the south-west
of Darfur, not far from Jebel Mara. In order to do this,
however, he would have to make a long detour to avoid an
encounter with the force under Slatin Bey, Governor of
Darfur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Operations
in Darfur.</div>

<p>Very little news has been received of the real state of
affairs in that far-off province. It appears that, on receipt
of orders from Cairo, a messenger was despatched from
Kartoum to El Fascher in April of the present year with the
following instructions for Slatin Bey&mdash;viz., to concentrate
the garrisons of Darfur at El Fascher, attempt to organise a
national Government under a descendant of one of the
former kings, and then withdraw from the country, either
to Dongola or Bahr el Ghazel. Report states that Slatin
Bey subsequently evacuated El Fascher, defeated a tribe of
hostile Hamr Arabs, and then intrenched himself at Omchanga,
in an important strategical position on the road to
El Obeyed, where he awaited the arrival of the garrison of
Foga before undertaking any further operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter
from Slatin
Bey, Governor
of
Darfur.</div>

<p>The above-mentioned orders do not appear to have
reached Slatin Bey, for on the 30th June he wrote as
follows to the Governor-General of the Soudan from Dara,
200 miles south of El-Fascher:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Up to this date I have fought 27 battles of more or
less importance, and have been twice wounded. I am
besides suffering from Guinea worm, and have consequently
been obliged to retire on Dar Demittala, but not before
killing in battle the Khalifa of Mohammed Ahmet, Bishari
Wal-ud-Bakis.</p>

<p>“I have not only to fight external but internal enemies.
Many of the Arab officers intrigue against me, and seek to
undermine my authority. They spread rumours that
Arabi has driven all the Europeans out of Egypt, and that
I myself have been deprived of my functions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span></p>

<p class="ls3">&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>“After the commencement of the rainy season, fighting
will begin again with the Razagatt, Habanieh and Mali
Arabs, and I am greatly in need of help, for my best
officers and men have fallen, and ammunition is beginning
to draw to an end.”</p>

<p class="ls3">&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;</p>

<p>“I ask your Excellency to send me a letter not in
cypher, setting forth my absolute power, and I take upon
myself, as long as I am alive, the responsibility of keeping
the Province of Darfur for the Government.”</p>

<p class="ls3">&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;&#10035;</p>

<p>The above letter reached Kartoum in August. It was in
reply to one from Giegler Pasha, dated 14th March, 1883,
which, Slatin Bey stated, was the first direct news he had
received from Kartoum for more than a year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">20th
August.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Appointment
of
General
Hicks as
Commander-in-Chief
of
the Expedition
to
Kordofan.
Plan of
campaign.</div>

<p>On the 20th August, General Hicks received a telegram
from the Khedive appointing him Commander-in-Chief of
the expedition to Kordofan, with the rank of General of
Division. His original plan was to leave Kartoum about
the 8th of September, and march up the White Nile as far
Berair,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> with 8600 infantry, 1400 cavalry and Bashi Bazouks,
one battery of Krupp field guns, two batteries of
mounted guns, and one battery of Nordenfeldts, and 5000
camels.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>Leaving the river at Berair, he proposed to march first
on Bara,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and then on El Obeyed, appearing before the
last-mentioned place with 7000 men, which it was considered
would be sufficient to overcome the Mahdi. About
3000 were to be employed in keeping open the line of communications.
But the idea of establishing a line of fortified
posts between the Nile and Kordofan was subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
abandoned, and it was decided that the whole force should
advance together, without attempting to keep up any communication
with the rear. The reason for adopting this
course was, that reports were brought in that large numbers
of hostile Arabs were likely to reappear on the line of
march after the passage of the army, and there would be
great difficulty in inducing small bodies of Egyptian troops
to escort convoys of stores between the posts.</p>

<p>The Egyptian officers attached to the force were inefficient,
and, as a rule, apathetic; they carried little or no
respect, and had but slight authority over their men. To
bring the army into a state of efficiency, feed it, provide
transport, and procure intelligence, taxed the energies of
General Hicks and his small European Staff to the utmost.
His greatest anxiety was regarding the water supply during
the march, for Kordofan is the driest province in the whole
Soudan. The wells along the roads across the desert contain
but little water, except immediately after the rains, and
it was feared that even then there would be insufficient for
a large force accompanied by horses, mules, and several
thousand camels.</p>

<p>On leaving the Nile, provisions for sixty days were to
be carried with the army.</p>

<p>Rashid Pasha, who was to have commanded a brigade,
telegraphed from Kassala that the Arabs in the neighbourhood
were in a state of great excitement, and he
thought it would be best for him to remain there till it had
subsided.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th September.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Departure
of the
army from
Kartoum.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 9th September the main body set out from
Kartoum, and, passing Berair, reached Duem<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> on the
20th. No hostility was shown along the route, though
many of the inhabitants fled on the approach of the troops.
The heat was intense, and there was considerable loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
of life among the camels during the march. The line of
telegraph had been destroyed.</p>

<p>On the 23rd September, an advanced force, consisting
of three battalions and six guns, seized the first water
station, fifteen miles from Duem, without encountering any
resistance.</p>

<p>General Hicks did not leave Kartoum till the 28th September,
when he proceeded up the river by steamer to
Duem, and then joined the main body.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">30th September.</div>

<p>On the 30th September the army encamped at a place
30 miles south-west of Duem. The heat was still intense,
and the camels were dying in considerable numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tactics of
the Egyptian
army.</div>

<p>The square continued to be used as the fighting formation.
Great precautions were taken on the line of march.
The army marched in three columns prepared instantly to
form square, with the camels and stores in the centre, the
guns in the front faces, and the Nordenfeldts at the angles.
Through constant practice, the men had become very
perfect in this manœuvre. When camping square was
formed, two tents per company were pitched behind piled
arms. When possible a zeriba, or dense abattis of thorny
bushes was formed round the square. In case of sudden
attack on the march, each soldier carried four crows-feet,
which he was to throw to a distance in his front to check
the rush of the assailing forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7th
October.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 7th October the army appears to have reached
Sangi Hamferid, 45 miles south-west of Duem, where it
remained halted for several days, owing to the uncertainty
of the water supply in front. At the camp there was no
water except on the surface in depressions of the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
The camels were dropping, but the troops were in good
health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">9th
October.</div>

<p>On the 9th October Colonel Farquhar made a reconnaissance
30 miles forward, and ascertained that the pools
were barely sufficient for a rapid march to Sarakna, at
which village there are a few wells.</p>

<p>The enemy was still retiring, and sweeping the country
bare of cattle. The uncut harvest supplied ample forage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spread of

Suakin.</div>

<div class="sidenote">August.</div>

<p>In the beginning of August rumours reached Suakin
that emissaries of the Mahdi were inciting the Arabs in
the neighbourhood of Sinkat<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and Erkowit<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> to revolt.
On the 2nd Tewfik Bey, the Governor of Suakin, left for
Sinkat, to inquire into the true state of affairs. He there
learned that Osman Digma, a well-known slave-dealer,
assisted by his nephews, Ahmed and Fagi Digma, had
raised the Erkowit, Sherah, Mishab, Migadaff, and Bishirieh
tribes in the name of the Mahdi. All these are small tribes,
living in the Erkowit district; but the more important
Langeb tribe, living in the neighbourhood of Toka, were
said to be preparing to rise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5th
August.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Defeat of
the rebels
at Sinkat.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>Tewfik Bey immediately summoned Digma to come
to him at Sinkat. He arrived on the 5th August, but accompanied
by about 1500 armed followers, and demanded,
in the name of the Mahdi, the surrender of Sinkat and
Suakin, with all the arms and treasure they contain. These
demands being, of course, refused, Digma attacked the
barracks and the summer residences of the Suakis spread
over the plain. The inhabitants defended themselves, and,
with the assistance of the troops, drove off the rebels after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
an hour’s fight. Digma was severely wounded, and his
two nephews and sixty-three other rebels were killed.
The number of their wounded is unknown. On the
Government side, seven soldiers and Suakis were killed
or died of their wounds.</p>

<p>The rebels retired to Erkowit, and it was reported that
they were much discouraged by their defeat.</p>

<p>By the 13th August the garrison of Sinkat, which on the
5th was only 100 strong, had been increased to 200. On
that date there were 100 soldiers, forty of whom were
artillerymen, and six Krupp 9-pounders at Suakin.  Some
measures were being taken for the defence of the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Uneasiness
at
Berber.</div>

<p>Some uneasiness was also felt at Berber, and, in consequence,
the Mudir of that place detained there two battalions
of infantry, which arrived early in August, on their
way to Kartoum.</p>

<p>It was reported that the last detachment of reinforcements
for General Hicks, consisting of 200 infantry and
300 Bashi-Bazouks, had been abandoned by their camel-drivers
and camels at a place called Kokreb, about half-way
between Suakin and Berber. What became of the troops
after the loss of their baggage and camels is not stated.</p>

<p>Although the attack on Sinkat had been repulsed with
loss, the appearance of the enemy in the rear of General
Hicks, and more or less commanding his line of communications,
was sufficiently serious to cause much uneasiness at
Cairo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">24th

<div class="sidenote">Despatch

<p>300 troops were despatched from Egypt to Suakin about

large reinforcements.</p>

<p>The telegraph line between Suakin and Sinkat was cut
on the 10th August. On the 8th October it was reported
that communication between those places and Berber,
which had been interrupted for some time, had been reestablished.</p>

<p>On the 5th November, a body of Egyptian troops,
variously estimated at from 250 to 500 men, were attacked
near Tokar<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> by a band of insurgents, and completely routed.
They are said to have thrown their arms away and taken
to flight, notwithstanding the efforts of their commander to
rally them. The reports are not very clear as to whether
the Egyptians were merely making a reconnaissance, or
were attempting to reach Kartoum by way of Kassala.
Commander Moncrieff,<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> late R.N., the British Consul at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>

<p>The latest accounts state that Tokar is still held for the

the 9th September, the order of march was as follows, viz.&mdash;Two
guides, mounted on camels, led the way. Behind
them rode a detachment of men in armour, followed by the
general staff. Then came a battalion of infantry in line,
with several battalions in column in rear of each of its
flanks. The artillery marched between the columns of
infantry. Another battalion in line formed the fourth side
of the infantry square.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> A detachment of cavalry completed
the fighting force. Behind it came a long train of
pack animals, led and protected by Bashi-Bazouks. The
rear was brought up by irregular cavalry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marching-out
strength.</div>

<p>The marching-out strength was 10,000 men, 4 Krupp
field guns, 10 mountain guns, 6 Nordenfeldts, 500 horses,
and 5500 camels.</p>

<p>Al-ed-Deen Pasha, the Governor-General of the Soudan,
started at the same time, proceeding as far as Duem by
steamer. He took in his suite several notables of great
influence, who were to be considered as hostages, and
answerable with their lives for any disturbances that might
break out in Kartoum during their absence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Precautions
on
the march.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the march every precaution was taken to guard
against surprise. The troops were always under arms, and
lined the “zerebas” an hour before daybreak, the usual
time for an Arab attack. The cavalry used to go out at
dawn, and not till then were the tents allowed to be struck
and the camels loaded. An hour later the whole force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
marched off. Owing to the enormous number of camels,
progress was slow. After twelve days’ marching, Duem,
110 miles from Omdurman, was reached, and the army
rested for four days. The heat was intense, and both men
and camels suffered considerably.</p>

<p>On quitting the Nile, General Hicks’s original intention
had been to retake Dara,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> before marching on El Obeyed,
but he altered his plans at the request of King Adam of
Takallé, who promised assistance in the event of the army
entering Kordofan from the south.</p>

<div class="sidenote">30th September.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>On the 30th September, General Hicks reached Zeraiga,
about 30 miles from Duem. The following despatch was
probably written at Sangi Hamferid,<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> some miles further
on, though neither the date nor the name of the place
is stated. It was sent by hand to Kartoum, and telegraphed
thence to Cairo on the 17th October. It runs as
follows, viz.: “The army has arrived within 28 miles of
Sarakhna. We have depended upon pools of rain-water
for supply, which we have fortunately found. A reconnaissance
made to-day ensures us water as far as Sarakhna.
Guide information is vague. I regret that I have to
abandon my intention of establishing military posts,
and line of communication with base at Duem. The
Governor-General assures me that the Arabs will close in
on my route after the army has passed in sufficient force
to prevent posts forwarding supplies; besides, the pools of
rain-water&mdash;the only supply&mdash;will dry up. Water not to
be obtained by digging wells. I have no information
regarding water between Sarakhna and Nurabi, nor reliable
information of the supply there. This causes me great
anxiety. I quite expected Sarakhna to be occupied by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
enemy, but the reconnaissance to-day found the place
evacuated. The Arabs had left this morning. The health
of the troops is, on the whole, good, which is fortunate, as
we have no sick carriage. The heat is intense.”</p>

<p>The following is the last dispatch received from General

1883”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for advancing
without
securing
line of
communications.</div>

<p>“On leaving Duem, on the White Nile, to march by the
Khor-el-Nil to Melbeis and El Obeyed, I decided that my
line of communication should be secured by posts of
200 men each, left in strongly fortified positions in the
following places: Schatt, 16 miles distant; Zeraiga,
16 miles distant; Sarakhna, 32 miles distant; Nurabi,
16 miles distant; Agaila, 24 miles distant; Johan, 32 miles
distant; Abli, 28 miles distant: Beliab, 22 miles distant;
Um Sheikh, 12 miles distant; Rahad, 14 miles distant;
Khashil (? Kazghil), 14 miles distant; Melbeis, 25 miles
distant.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>“At all these places I was informed water would be
found.</p>

<p>“Large quantities of biscuits were to arrive at Duem,
and as we were unable to leave a single camel at the base,
1000 were ordered to be purchased and forwarded to
Duem.</p>

<p>“His Excellency Al-ed-Deen Pasha had already at Kartoum
300, and gave orders for the remaining 700 to be
purchased and forwarded to Duem without delay.</p>

<p>“The biscuits would then, with ammunition and other
stores, be pushed on to the front from post to post.</p>

<p>“Depôts would be formed at each post, and, in case of a
reverse, a line of retreat secured, the troops falling back
upon these depôts, where we should be certain of finding
supplies of food, ammunition, and water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>“We marched to Schatt, and formed the first post and
depôt there; but, before reaching Zeraiga, I was informed
by the Governor-General of the Soudan that it was useless
for me to expect any supplies to be pushed up from Duem,
that the soldiers left at the posts would not guard the convoys;
in fact, that they would be afraid to do so; that, to
insure supplies being forwarded, an army would be required
with each convoy; that the Arabs, although now absent
from our line of route, would return after we had passed,
and that they would be numerous, and the garrisons of the
posts would not consider themselves strong enough to forward
the supplies; that it would be dangerous; and I
would find that they would not run the risk.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General requested me to abandon the
idea of having this line of posts&mdash;to give up my line of
communications and line of retreat, and to advance with
the army <i>en l’air</i>, with 50 days’ supply of food only, the
Arabs closing in on our rear.</p>

<p>“I am naturally very averse to this, but if, as his Excellency
assures me, it is a fact that the posts will not be
supplied from the base at Duem, and supplies will not be
forwarded through them, I should, in garrisoning these
posts, be only weakening my fighting force without gaining
any advantage. I have therefore called a Council, have
had the matter explained, and requested the members to
record their opinions.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>No news of the Expeditionary Force having been heard

Messengers were despatched from Duem along the various
routes to Kordofan, but, for a long while, none of the few

<div class="sidenote">30th

Rumoured
defeat of
the Mahdi.</div>

<p>On the 30th October, rumours were spread in Kartoum
that the Mahdi had been defeated in several important
engagements, and that General Hicks was master of the
whole of Kordofan. No official confirmation of the reported
victories was, however, received, and after a few days the
authenticity of the news began to be doubted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5th November.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Kazghil.
Annihilation
of
General
Hicks’s
army.</div>

<div class="sidenote">1883.</div>

<p>At length, on the 19th November, a messenger, who had
failed to deliver his despatches to Al-ed-Deen Pasha, returned
to Duem, bringing news of the total destruction of
General Hicks’s army. These sad tidings were soon confirmed
by other persons arriving from Kordofan. Their
accounts differ in detail, but most of them agree that the
greater part, if not the whole, of the army was annihilated
by the insurgent forces on the 4th or 5th November.
The events which culminated in this terrible disaster are
still shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. Nothing has
been heard from any of the Europeans who accompanied
the expedition, nor from any of the Egyptian Staff
Officers, of a later date than General Hicks’s despatch of
the 3rd October. Probably the most trustworthy account
of the fighting is that given by a camel-driver, who went as
servant to a native officer. He states that the army, on
leaving Duem, soon met the rebels, and engaged in skirmishes
with them, the Mahdi’s men being beaten, and the
Egyptians losing a few Bashi-Bazouks and Shaggyehs.
Thus the army arrived at Rahad, where there is a lake.
There it filled up with water, and then marched towards
Alouba. At the latter place there was an encounter
with the rebels, in which General Hicks was victorious.
On the 2nd November the army left Alouba, taking what
water it could, and, while marching through a forest, was
surprised by a large force of rebels. The Egyptians
formed square, and, after fighting all day, finally defeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
them and drove them off. On Saturday, the 3rd November,
the march was resumed. Water was already becoming
scarce. The rebels again appeared in force, and surrounded
the army. A serious engagement ensued, in which heavy
losses were suffered on both sides, but the rebels were once
more beaten. That night was passed on the field of battle,
and next day the army moved towards Kazghil. After
proceeding for four hours, it suddenly came under a heavy
fusillade from large numbers of the enemy. The troops
were suffering great torments from thirst, but nevertheless
fought throughout the whole day. On the 5th, when they
were approaching the wells, which were only half an hour
distant, the rebels, who had been concealed in the forest,
again suddenly attacked the column on all sides. The
Egyptians returned their fire, and a great battle raged.
Towards mid-day the entire force of the rebels made a
general charge with guns, swords, and spears, and General
Hicks and his whole army perished, except 200 Egyptian
soldiers and a few negro servants, most of whom were
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>Of the whole of the expeditionary force, the only European
supposed to be now alive is Adolf Klootz, formerly a
sergeant of Prussian Uhlans, and recently servant to Major
von Seckendorff. He is said to have deserted three days
before the final struggle, to have commanded the insurgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
artillery during the action, and to be at present an officer
in the service of the Mahdi.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;The following is the Extract of a letter from the
Mahdi’s Emir at Berber to Zubair, by whom it was
forwarded to Sir Henry Gordon.</p>

<hr class="dec2" />

<p class="pc reduct">Letter of the Emir Ali Mohammed Abou Saad Esshentrawi al
Abadi (the Mahdi’s Emir at Berber).</p>

<p class="p1">“Compliments,&mdash;After the arrival of Hussein Pasha
Khalifat in the Soudan, it was found that all the inhabitants
were aroused by the appearance of the Imam.
Since this every week a disturbance took place among the
Arabs and Jahleien and others. We tried to put down the
disturbances. While we were trying to do so, news came
that the influence of the Imam the Mahdi was established,
and that all the districts of Darfur and Bahr el Ghezel, and
Kordofan, Sennaar, and Jebel Khadir, and the Arabs, all of
them, were under him. Why this was so was that they saw
and heard what he has done to the backsliders at the battle
of Jebel Khadir and in the slaughter of Yusuf Pasha
Shelali and his army of 8000 men, and in the destruction of
Al-ed-Deen Pasha and his army of 36,000 men, which was
altogether destroyed in a quarter of an hour. It was a
fearful fight, in which you heard only the slashing of swords
into the bodies. At that time we received letters from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
lord the Imam strictly ordering us to fight the backsliders
and to block the way against all mischief-makers whatever,
which we prepared to do. Then came to us Mohammed
El Kheir Ibu Abdullah, Governor-General of the district of
Berber, bringing with him standards of victory prepared
for the siege of Berber. When he arrived at Metemma, he
wrote letters to all the districts, calling for the aid of all
the tribes and Arabs. It was only a short time after that
he came to Berber with an army of 40,000 men, the
youngest of whom were eager to die in the field for the
sake of God. This was on the 1st Rejeb, 1301. Correspondence
took place between the Governor and the Pasha
for the space of eight days, and on Monday, the night of
the 23rd Rejeb, the battle was fought; and before break of
day we had won the victory and had killed all who opposed
the Mahdi, and captured the Pasha. Then all the inhabitants
of Bertou, of Berkou, of Islih, of Balalah, of Baskirmah,
and of Salah came into the Imam, and then his reign
was established in all the Soudan, east and west. This is
what happened in these parts; and know, my friend, that
the world is turned upside down, and henceforward there
will be nothing but preparation for the holy war in the path
of God, and spending of treasure and life in what pleases
Him and His Prophet. Be on your guard against the
covetousness of the world.</p>

<p>“As to your spy, Mohammed Abou Jibali, who was sent
with your men, after they came to Berber, and had seen
the Governor, and had permission to go to Kartoum, when
they reached Shendy the Governor thought it better that
they should return to Berber&mdash;which they did on the
1st Ramadan. They were imprisoned till the 20th. Then
eight mounted men came from among your relatives, and
had a conference with the Governor, who then released
them, and they went to your friends living near Kartoum.
After they left, the spy, Mohammed Abou Jibali, was detained,
and imprisoned in Berber, as before, till the 3rd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>

him away safely to you. I hope he will arrive in safety,
and will tell you how honestly we have acted for you.</p>

servant from his Majesty the King of Kings of Abyssinia,
with a special messenger from him, and a request that we
would receive and forward them to your Excellency where-ever
you may be found. Therefore we now send these
messengers with them. And we trust that after you have
honoured them with your attention that your Excellency

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Saleh Bey, Governor of Galabat.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">To his Excellency the Honourable the Governor-General
of the Soudan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4">Your servant, who stands in the attitude of service
(to you), prays God with a sincere heart to grant his request
and to extend His goodness towards me, in strengthening
and preserving your Excellency under His shadow for the
sake of the servants and subjects (of Government), and to
change the condition of affairs from what they are, and to
grant me the honour of seeing your Excellency, to kiss
your bountiful hands, by which we have been covered with
good and with blessings;&mdash;(even you who are) the destroyer
of the enemies of the Government, the wicked rebels who
have lost their souls and their religion, and are deprived
of the benefits of the Government, from which they had
obtained glory and honour; and turned, in spite of (all)
that, from truth to error. May God preserve the glory of
Government (so that) by presence of your Excellency you
may destroy and utterly ruin the wretched Mohammed
Ahhmed and his followers.</p>

<p>We have also to-day heard from the neighbourhood of
Dukah of Abou Sitti and of Abou Haraz about what the
energy of your Excellency has accomplished in beating the
rebels and dispersing their people and troops, assembled
for purposes of sedition.</p>

<p>And I beseech God most High, to whom be praise, to
stretch out the sword of your Government more (and more)&mdash;(in
order) to annihilate the false pretences of Mohammed
Ahhmed, and to disperse his wicked hordes.</p>

<p>If your thoughts be directed towards your servant and
the humble subject of the Government&mdash;(I have to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
that) at present date I am well, under your protection, and
am still continuing in the attitude of service to the Government.
And oh! what a Government! (it is). How much
compassion and benefit and kindness have you bestowed
on us in goodness and bounty, which no man can deny?
I pray in the name of God and of His prophet that your
servant may never depart from this path of duty (fidelity&mdash;being)
obedient to the Government openly, without hindrance&mdash;under
your protection.</p>

<p>With regard to the subjects of the Government under
the care of your servant&mdash;they do not cease to remain as
they were in respect of submission and obedience (loyalty),
and will never follow the ways of rebellion&mdash;by the mercy
of God most High and as a result of the advantage of being
under your Government.</p>

<p>But, Excellency, we are surrounded by the enemy on all
sides; from the side of the Dukah, by the Shukryeh, by the
Dhāniyeh, and by the Ja’alibiyeh: as on the side of the
river, by the Rahbar; also by the Bukādi, and those rebels
who follow them.</p>

<p>But by the influence of your Excellency no harm will
come to us from them. Nor do we take account of him
(the Mahdi); our Lord will make us victorious over him
through the strength of the Government and the reputation
of its power and majesty, from which we derive glory and
honour, through your Excellency and the favour of the
Khedive.</p>

<p>As to what we have enclosed about &mdash;&mdash;, we trust
and pray for the answer. Including this time we have now
written to you four times.</p>

<p>The messenger takes them (the letters) from here, and
when he gets to Katarif, or Dukah, he finds liers in
wait, and the rebels torment him on meeting him in the
road.</p>

<p>This prevented us from writing lately, but we are in
constant communication with the Mudiriyeh; and in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
road we have lost two persons by (hands of) the rebels of
Dhāniyeh and of Bukkād, on the road of Tumruk.</p>

<p>This for the information of your Excellency.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Saleh Bey, Governor of Salahah.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">To His Excellency the Honourable the Governor-General of the
Soudan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="pi4">I have the honour to lay before your Excellency
that at the beginning of the month of Rajeb, from the time
of the desertion and change of conduct of the Shukriyeh
and the Dhāniyeh, and the Jaalāni, and the Bukkādi, in
forsaking loyalty to Government and corrupting their ways
when they joined the wretch (the Mahdi) and his followers:
as soon as we received news of their having thrown off
their allegiance we communicated with the Mudiriyeh in
the month aforesaid. And these four tribes combined
together against us and besieged us on the side of Dukah,
having with them one called Hussein Abd el Wāhhad, and
they wrote to us as to their intention that we should follow
them into error, or they would fight and hem us in. When
we perceived this, and that it was then the season of
autumn and the time for sowing our seed for necessary
provisions&mdash;and that their wicked intention was to prevent
the inhabitants from sowing their grain, and that the
soldiery we had were very few; we tried by means of
diplomacy and artifice with their chief Hussein, to get them
to leave us during the autumn (seed time).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span></p>

<p>All that passed between us and them we have communicated
in detail to the Mudiriyeh from time to time&mdash;so
that there should be no misunderstanding from our silence&mdash;about
what we wrote to them for putting them off by
diplomacy, as it seemed best to us for bringing them to
reason. And please God, after tranquillity is established,
we will hasten to make copies of all the communications
which have passed with them, as well as of what we wrote
to the Mudiriyeh. On your seeing them you will know the
zeal of your servant in upholding his office; and his exertions
for honour of the Government, whose bounties overwhelm
him, will appear.</p>

<p>And, Sir, now that autumn is over and these four tribes
above mentioned are now in Katarif, and as there is great
energy displayed in assembling them for the certain purpose
of besieging Kalabât (Galabât), it became necessary to
inform your Excellency, trusting and praying for issue of
your Excellency’s order, sanctioning all that we do for the
purpose of impeding and destroying those wretches before
named. And with the help of the most High God your
servant will do nothing but what will lead to victory, and
will increase the supremacy of the Government and the
destruction of its enemies. It is not to be hidden from
your Excellency about Mohammed Bey Zain, that when
the Mudiriyeh sent orders to the Ma’amoor (district officer)
of Katarif for payment of 6000 dollars for payment of the
salaries of the officials of Galabât, an officer and thirty-five
soldiers were appointed to receive that amount from
the officials of Katarif. And when they were coming to
Galabât, Mahmood Bey, the above-named, took the money
from them and left the officer to go his way. We wrote at
the time to the Mudiriyeh about it, telling what Mahmood
had done, and also to his Excellency, Mahmood Bey, and
received his reply (denying) that the sum had been given
to him at all, and refusing to have any more communication
on the subject. And we made copy of what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
received from him, and we wrote about him to the
Mudiriyeh, and his answer is preserved by us in case of
necessity.</p>

<p class="p1"><i>Postscript.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>, We learn from the Mudiriyeh of Saka
(by letter) of this date of what the energy of your Excellency
has done there to impede and repulse the rebels.
They are joyful to-day at not being besieged as hitherto,
and the neighbourhood is pretty clear at present. At this
date there is perfect safety on account of the water from
their being surrounded. After this month the crossing of
the rivers will become possible, and (then) without doubt
the rebels will be able to get at them. Your servant is
constantly writing to the General of his troops to be always
wide awake, and to look out for the preservation and the
safety of the honour of the Government.</p>

me to come here, in order that by my relations with His

<p>His Majesty’s Government is much distressed about its

is very strict; if the Mahdi himself is at the head of the
besiegers; if you have provisions and munitions, and for
how many months; how many Greeks and Europeans
there are in Kartoum, together with their names; how
many soldiers have you, and what is the spirit of the

give him a letter, in very small form, in order that he may

<p class="pc1 reduct">From Slatin Bey.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">His Excellency Gordon Pasha, Governor-General of the Soudan.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Your Excellency,</span></p>

<p class="pi6">I have sent two letters, one by George Calamatino
and the other by my servant, without having received an
answer from your Excellency, neither has Consul Hansall
answered me.</p>

<p>Your Excellency, I have fought twenty-seven times for
the Government against the enemy, and they have beaten
me twice, and I have done nothing dishonourable, nothing
which should hinder your Excellency from writing me an
answer, that I may know what to do.</p>

<p>They have taken the little steamer at Dar-Djumna, after
it passed the Sehelal of the Robatat, and they have brought
the whole of the letters from Kartoum for Cairo here. In
order to assure you that they have taken the steamer they
have sent your Excellency some letters, and I have done
all that I could to send your Military Journal,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> because it
may be, perhaps, of some value for your Excellency.</p>

<p>I hope that Consul Hansall has made a translation of
my letter, in which I place all my feeble services to your
Excellency’s disposal, and I have been obliged to write in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
German, because they have burnt my French dictionary,
believing that it was a prayer book.</p>

<p>His Excellency Stewart Pasha, with nine men, is dead.
They have taken the others to Berber.</p>

<p>When you have a letter for Dongola I beg you to send
it me, and I will find means of sending it on.</p>

<p>Your scribe has written a dispatch in cipher, half Arabic
and half cipher, so badly, that they have been able to decipher
it, and so they have found a key to your despatches, and have
also deciphered your Excellency’s despatch to his Excellency
Towfik Pasha. If there are letters from Europe for me at
the post I beg you to send them me, because it is almost
three years since I have had any news of my family. I
entreat your Excellency to honour me with an answer.</p>

<p class="pr6">Your devoted and obedient servant,</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Slatin</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">I and Seid Gjoma, Mudir of Fascher, are seeking occasion
to enter Omdurman to remain with you. Pray, Excellency,
do your best to give us permission, because we
are always in fear of spies. I pray God that He may
give you success in the siege.</p>

<p class="p1">P.S.&mdash;If your Excellency has perhaps understood that I
have done anything contrary to the honour of an officer,
and if that hinders you from writing to me, I pray you give
me a chance of defending myself, and judge according to
truth.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">To the Governor-General of the Soudan and its dependencies,
to His Excellency the Honourable.</p>

<p class="p1">We stated to your Excellency that on Oct. 6, 1884,
we had the honour to receive the order of your Excellency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
dated September 24, announcing the arrival of
nine regiments of the braves of the English army and
Moslems of India; artillery, cavalry, and infantry of the
army, experienced in passing mountains, plains, and rough
places, with new cannons and powerful horses. And our
reading it to the public and publishing it in the country
produced great rejoicing and happiness in all, and they
augured all good and every benefit, and they are all praying
for victory and success for you and for the army. And
please God they are arrived at Berber and have taken possession
of it, and have arrived at Kartoum. Everybody at
Sennaar and the neighbourhood&mdash;Ulema, merchants, citizens,
notables, officers, and soldiers&mdash;kiss the hands of your
Excellency, and we proclaim about your Excellency, that

<p class="pc1 reduct">Letter from the Mahdi to General Gordon.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God the merciful and compassionate:
praise be to God, the bountiful Ruler, and blessing on our
lord Mahomed with peace.</p>

<p>From the servant who trusts in God&mdash;Mahomed the
son of Abdallah.</p>

<p>To Gordon Pasha of Kartoum: may God guide him into
the path of virtue, amen!</p>

<p>Know that your small steamer, named <i>Abbas</i>&mdash;which
you sent with the intention of forwarding your news to
Cairo, by the way of Dongola, the persons sent being your
representative Stewart Pasha and the two Consuls, French
and English, with other persons, has been captured by the
will of God.</p>

<p>Those who believed in us as the Mahdi, and surrendered,
have been delivered; and those who did not were destroyed&mdash;as
your representative afore-named, with the
Consuls and the rest&mdash;whose souls God has condemned to
the fire and to eternal misery.</p>

<p>That steamer and all that was in it have fallen a prey to
the Moslems, and we have taken knowledge of all the
letters and telegrams which were in it, in Arabic and in
Frankish (languages), and of the maps, which were opened
to us (translated) by those on whom God has bestowed
His gifts, and has enlightened their hearts with faith, and
the benefits of willing submission. Also (we have found
therein) the letters sent from you to the Mudir of Dongola,
with the (letters, &amp;c.) accompanying, to be forwarded to
Egypt and to European countries. All has been seized,
and the contents are known. It should all have been
returned to you, not being wanted here; but as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
originally sent from you, and is known unto you, we prefer
to send you part of the contents and mention the property
therein, so that you may be certified; and in order that the
truth may make a lasting impression on thy mind&mdash;in the
hope that God may guide thee to the faith of Islam, and to
surrender; that you and your followers may surrender to
Him and to us, that so you and they may obtain everlasting
good and happiness.</p>

<p>Now first (among the documents seized) is the cipher
dated Sept. 22, 1884, sent to Mustafa Jāwer, Mudir of
Dongola, in answer to his letter dated 30th August,
1884, European reckoning, (saying) that you have given
him the rank of Liwa&mdash;on the back of which is your telegram
to the Khedive of Egypt, asking that he will confirm
the said appointment. We have also taken knowledge of
(extract from) the Journal (daily record) of the provision
in the granary (as) seen by the Inspector Moosa Othmān,
namely 3374 ardebs of dhoora; 4 ardebs and ⅓ and ¼ of
wheat, &amp;c. Also (extract from) the Journal<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> (daily register)
of the ammunition seized by the Inspector Mohamed,
dated Aug. 18, 1884&mdash;the number (? of cartridges)
in store being 581,395.</p>

<p>Also of the telegram sent to the Khedive of Egypt, and
Nubar Pasha, and to the English Consul-General from
nineteen persons who have put their seals to it, and who
are presidents of the Court of Appeal, (namely) Hassan
Abdul Munam, and the members and the merchants,
who pray (therein) that the Soudan Railway, which the
Egyptian Government find it difficult to make, (may be)
exchanged for river steamers and military stations, with
telegraphic lines between the stations.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<p>Further, (there is) the letter (found) with the French
Consul, written by you to him on July 12, 1884, No. 512/38,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
in acknowledgment of the 100 francs distributed to the poor
and needy.</p>

<p>(There is) also your letter dated August 28, 1884,
No. 35/144, sent to Nubar Pasha, and to the English
Consul-General, and to the Chief of the Egyptian Treasury,
with information about the 50,000 guineas sent from
Egypt to Berber, and captured by the auxiliaries of the
faith, and mentioning the advances (made) by the merchants
at interest of one piastre per 100 piastres, with the hope of
paying it back to the principals or their agents in that
part.</p>

<p>(There is) also your communication dated August 26,
1884, No. 34/144, sent to the President of the Council, with
a list of sixteen persons, in which you ask for confirmation
of the rank which you have bestowed on them.</p>

<p>Also your letter, No. 1/141, dated August 14, 1884, to
the Mohurdâr (Keeper of the Seals) of the Khedive, as
to disposal of the four decorations you have given, and of
which you enclose a specimen.</p>

<p>Also (as to) the ranks of the officers named by you,
and the note containing eleven names, like Nuehr Bey
Mahomed, Commandant of the Army of Sennaar, whom
you made Liwa (General).</p>

<p>Also your telegram, dated Sept. 3, 1884, No. 23, to
the afore-mentioned Mohurdâr (Keeper of the Seals), to
confirm the appointment of Ibrahim Foozi, and Mohammed
Nefii, and Moosa Shoki as Liwas (Generals).</p>

<p>Also your letters, (written) in European (language), all
about the siege of Kartoum, and all about the arranging of
the steamers, with the number of the troops in them, and
their arms, and the cannon, and about the movements of
the troops, and the defeat of your people, and your request
for reinforcements, even if only a single regiment, and all
about how your agent Cuzzi turned Moslem.</p>

<p>Also many letters which had come to you from our lieutenants,
and what they contained of advice; also stating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
number of Europeans at Kartoum, 3 English, 2 Austrians,
1 Prussian, 1 Frenchman, 4 Italians, 40 Greeks.</p>

<p>Also the diary (registry) of the arms, ammunition, guns
and soldiers sealed by Faraj (Ferratch) ez Zainy, Commander
of the Army, which has 2 Krupp guns and 284
shells; 11 mountain field-pieces, and their ammunition
(? cartridges), numbering 2303; 2 matchlock guns and their
ammunition, 315; 5 mortars and their ammunition 565;
and 1 field piece, and 2 mitrailleuses without ammunition;
and 8 howitzers (?) and their ammunition, 599; and 7064
Remington rifles, and 1205 percussion muskets; and 246
muskets (called) arshalik; and 127 rifles, old bore, and
19 pistols; and the ammunition (cartridges) for the Remingtons
being 150,233 packets. And the number of the
soldiers: 2 Liwas (Generals), 2 Colonels, 5 Lieut.-Colonels,
and so on for other grades, and 2370 privates; the contingent
of Bashi-Bazouk, and of the Shaggyeh and Khotriyeh
and others, the amount of their strength (being)
26 divisions, numbering 4797 men. Also giving the number
of the servants of the arsenal and on the steamers, ship by
ship.</p>

<p>We have also taken knowledge of the two letters of
Salehh, the Melek of the Sanjak (district) of Sanik, which
he gave up to us (the Mahdi).</p>

<p>One of them, dated April 30, 1884, in which he threatens
(this); and the second, dated May 1, in which he states
that which he has already stated, and in which he asks for
his reward.</p>

<p>We have also noted the telegram of the officials and of
the presidents of courts, and of the Kadi and the Muftis
and Ulema, numbering 34 sent to the Mohurdâr of the
Khedive in Egypt, dated August 28, 1884, in which they
ask for succour from the Egyptian Government; to which
was attached your note to the Mudir of Dongola on
account of his drafts. Also your cipher telegrams, one
of which is dated August 8, 1884, to the Mohurdâr of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
Khedive, in which you explain that on your arrival at
Kartoum the impossibility had become clear to you of
withdrawing the troops and the employés, and sending
them to Egypt; on account of the disturbances (rebellions)
in the country, and the cutting (closing) of the roads; for
which reason you ask for reinforcements, which did not
come until that happened which has happened to the
Mudiriyeh of Berber.</p>

<p>Also about your coming to Kartoum with seven men after
the annihilation of Hicks’s army; and your requesting a
telegram to be sent to you in Arabic, in plain language
about the Soudan, to show to the people of Kartoum&mdash;as
the telegrams in European cipher do not explain enough,
except only certain news (matters), and their meaning is
not intelligible, except only certain things (which are understood).</p>

<p>And also (you refer) to the useless waste of time, so
much so, that from your repeated promises to the people of
Kartoum about arrival of reinforcements, you have appeared
to them as if you were a liar.</p>

<p>Also (about) your asking for Turkish troops and your
promise to send your representative, Stewart, and Mr.
Power to Dongola, both of whom the Most High God has
destroyed.</p>

<p>And the second (telegram) with the same date and the
same tenor, to the President of the Council and the English
Minister in Cairo.</p>

<p>And the third (telegram) dated August 28, 1884, to the
Mohurdâr (of the Khedive), in which you promise to send
a detachment to attack Sheikh el Obeyed; which you sent,
and the Most High God has destroyed.</p>

<p>Also your letter to the Khedive of Egypt, without date,
in which you ask to have English soldiers sent, and appoint
Zubair Pasha with reinforcements for withdrawal of the
Egyptian troops to Egypt, and that you (will) give the
Soudan to the Sultan on the arrival of the reinforcements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
of 200,000 men. And (you state that) if this be not done
those in the Soudan will be killed, and their blood will be
on their conscience (i.e. those to whom he writes will be
responsible for their deaths). And the last you say in it
(is) that Mahomed Ali Pasha is the only and single one
in the Soudan on whom you (could) rely to take your
place. But God has destroyed Mohamed Ali Pasha, on
whom you rely.</p>

<p>The fourth telegram is dated August 28, to the Khedive
of Egypt, and to Nubar Pasha and the English Consul in
Egypt, in which you say that you were expecting the
reinforcements before asked for&mdash;by way of Merowé&mdash;and
also state the telegrams sent to the above-named at that
date; in which you speak about fighting my auxiliaries,
and about your having provisions for five months.</p>

<p>Also the telegram, dated August 25, 1884, to the above-mentioned,
in which you pretend (suppose) that Ibrahim el
Obeyed has been killed. And you say that you have the
news of our arrival, which, however, was not confirmed.</p>

<p>And your letter to the President of the Council and the
English Minister in Cairo, dated August 8, 1884, in which
you speak of your appointing three steamers to go and
inquire as to the state of Sennaar, and that you will send
soldiers to Berber by the steamers to recapture it, sending
with them Stewart and the Consuls, whom the Most High
God has destroyed.</p>

<p>And the telegram, dated August 8, 1884, sent to the
President of the Council and the English Minister, in
which you promise to send 2000 soldiers to Berber for
recovering it, and (say) that unless the reinforcements come
to strengthen Berber, when the water of the Nile gets
lower the same thing will happen again to Berber which
had (already) happened.</p>

<p>Also your telegram to the Khedive of Egypt and Nubar
Pasha, dated Sept. 8, 1884, in which you say it was your
purpose to remove those (the garrison, &amp;c.) at Sennaar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
but that you saw that it would not be done; and (you
mention) the sorrow of the inhabitants and of the employés
at Kartoum and Sennaar at the non-arrival of
succour.</p>

<p>Also the telegram, dated Sept. 9, to the Khedive of
Egypt and Nubar Pasha and to the General, in which
you speak of the sending of Stewart and those with him
by the small steamer, and (with) the two large steamers
escorting them for protection. And that you had so many
times already asked for succour, and had deep anxiety for
the state of the Soudan.</p>

<p>And (stating) that you had received no answer whatever,
so that the people had become disgusted.</p>

<p>Also your telegram, dated August 28, 1884, stating that
(as to) the Firmān emanating from the Khedive to all
the nobles and notables and people of the Soudan, announcing
the withdrawal of the troops of the Government from
it, and their evacuation of the country, (and) leaving it to
the Soudanese to appoint rulers of the country from among
the natives,&mdash;you had not been able to communicate or to
show it to anybody on account of what had taken place.</p>

<p>Also (we have seen) the two seals engraved with our
name to imitate our seal.</p>

<p>We never miss any of your news, nor what is in your
innermost thoughts, and about the strength and support&mdash;not
of God&mdash;on which you rely. We have now understood
it all.</p>

<p>Tricks in making ciphers, and using so many languages,
are of no avail.</p>

<p>From the Most High God, to whom be praise, no secrets
can be hidden.</p>

<p>As to your expecting reinforcements, reliance for succour
on others than God, that will bring you nothing but destruction,
and (cause you to) fall into utmost danger in this
world and the next.</p>

<p>For God most High has dispersed sedition through our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
manifestation, and has vanquished the wicked and obstinate
people, and has guided those who have understanding to
the way of righteousness.</p>

<p>And there is no refuge but in God, and in obedience to
His command, and that of His Prophet and of His Mahdi.</p>

<p>No doubt you have heard what has happened to your
brethren, from whom you expected help, at Suakin and
elsewhere, whom God has destroyed, and dispersed and
abandoned.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, as we have now arrived at
Mushra’ el Koweh’, at a day’s journey from Omdurman, and
are coming, please God, to your place, if you return to the
Most High God, and become a Moslem, and surrender to
His order and that of His Prophet, and believe in us as the
Mahdi, send us a message from thee, and from those with
thee, after laying down your arms and giving up the
thought of fighting, so that I may send you one with safe
conduct, by which you will obtain (assurance of) benefit of
the blessing in this world and the next. Otherwise, and if
you do not act thus, you will have to encounter war from
God and His Prophet. And know that the Most High
God is mighty (able) for thy destruction, as He has
destroyed (others) before thee, who were much stronger
than thou, and more numerous.</p>

<p>And you, and your children and your property, will be
for a prey to the Moslems, and you will repent when
repentance will not avail. For, after the beginning of the
battle were you to surrender, it would be from fear, and not
willingly, and that will not be accepted.</p>

<p>And there is no succour or strength but in God, and
peace be upon those who have followed the Guidance.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

Bahhri and seized, you mention that the troops present in
Bahr Gazelle and the Equator and elsewhere (number)
30,000 soldiers, whom you cannot leave behind, even though
you should die.</p>

<p>And know that Bahr Gazelle and the Equator are both
of them under our hand (power), and that both have
followed us as Mahdi, and that they and their chief and all
their officers are now among the auxiliaries of the Mahdi.
And they have joined our lieutenant in that part, and
letters from them are constantly coming and going without
hindrance, or diminution of numbers.</p>

<p>And here inclosed are two letters of those which we have

them thou wilt understand and know if Bahr Gazelle is

<p class="pc1 reduct">Letter from Mohammed Sheikh Mohammed Kerkasâwi to
Achmet, son of Suleiman.</p>

<p class="p1">In the name of God the Merciful and Compassionate.
Praise be to God the Supreme Ruler, and blessing and
peace upon our lord Mahomed and his successors with
salutation.</p>

<p>From the Fakir of God, the humble and lowly, Mahomed
Sheikh Mahomed Kerkasâwi to our brother and beloved in
God, to</p>

<p>Achmed, son of Suleiman, Receiver General of the
Treasury of the Moslems. May God preserve him. Amen!</p>

<p>After praying for the peace of God and His blessing and
mercy upon you; if you inquire after me (I can say that) I
am by God’s help in possession of all the conditions of
good health.</p>

<p>As to the information which we have to give you (it)
is that on the arrival of the Emir Karm Illah Sheikh
Mohammed in the parts of Bahr Gazelle and the neighbourhood
of Sirkua, your servant had been appointed to
the office of gathering in the crops; and we had not
received news of his arrival, excepting from the letter
which reached us from the Emir Abdullah,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> surnamed
Bilbitn, in which he asked my presence at the seat of the
Mudiriyeh. On my arrival at the seat afore-named, I got
to know positively about that, and after that I tried, with
the Emir Abdullah, to obtain the consent and surrender
(of the people there) without delay.</p>

<p>In the interval there came two dervishes from the Emir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
Karm Illah; in their hands were several letters to us and
to some of the brethren, and to the Emir Abdullah.</p>

<p>After these letters had been carefully read by us, the
Emir Abdullah stopped the (carrying out of the) surrender
to the Emir (Karm Illah), because no letter had been sent
to him to his (own) address by his Highness.</p>

<p>So we and all the brethren used our utmost efforts with
him, (urging) the desirableness of (his) sending a letter
from him to the Emir Karm Illah, requesting him (the
latter) to send (on) the letter of his Highness that it
might be considered, and as to settling the mode of surrender.
And this was done. When the letter was written,
I received it, and went with it in company of the two
dervishes above-named, and with us went the Sheikh
Wakîa’ Allah Edrisi and Mahomed Sālim esh Shareef;
and Haj Omar, all of them of the inhabitants of this seat
(of the Mudiriyeh), they being appointed with me by order
of the Emir Abdullah for bringing quickly the Proclamation
written by H. E. the Mahdi.</p>

<p>On our arrival at (the place of) Karm Illah, and on his
reading the letter of the said Emir (Abdullah), he ordered
copy to be made of the Proclamation and gave it to me.
Those appointed with me of the inhabitants of the seat (of
the Mudiriyeh) also wrote a message as they remained
with the Emir Karm Illah. On receiving the letter from
the afore-named, I came back with it to the Emir Abdullah,
who on reading it with intelligence, in the presence of the
brethren, all of them became delighted and filled with
happiness and joy which could not be exceeded.</p>

<p>Especially the Emir Abdullah obeyed and accepted (the
terms of) the proclamation of his Highness; and so everything
was settled with the help of God, the Lord to whom
worship (is due).</p>

<p>All the brethren are longing to see his Highness, and so
the letters were written from the Emir Abdullah and the
brethren in the form of a deed (compact) of submission by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
them, and of obedience to the Emir Karm Illah, appointed
by his Highness the Mahdi, which I took, and went to the
town of Yānikah, the place where the afore-named Emir
was encamped; and I delivered it to him, and on his
reading and understanding it, his countenance expressed
joy thereat. And he wrote a letter to the Emir Abdullah,
informing him of his being about to leave the town of
Yānikah, and to come to the seat of the Mudiriyeh on
Tuesday, the 25th of Jamād el Akhar, 1301, and he gave
the safe conduct for all&mdash;for themselves, their families, and
their property. And, praise be to God Most High, on the
day named we and the Emir Karm Illah, and the troops
with him, arrived at an hour’s distance from the seat (of
the Mudiriyeh). And the Emir Abdullah and all the
notables and the brethren came to meet us outside of the
wooden stockade surrounding the seat (of the Mudiriyeh).
The meeting was like the meeting of dear friends with each
other, and it was a memorable day for all that was accomplished
therein, and for the filling up of (our) joy.</p>

<p>On our entering the Mahhkameh (Court of Justice) of
the Mudiriyeh, and on the friends and the Emirs being
seated, the Emir Abdullah rose, and, standing upright,
uttered the two declarations of testimony, saying, “I
testify that there is no God but God; and I testify that
our Lord Mohammed is the prophet of God, blessing
be upon him, and that the (Seyyed<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>) Lord Mohammed, son
of the Lord Abdullah, he (is) the Mahdi and Khalif of
God and His prophet.” Likewise (after this) the two Copts
Gabriel B’abal and Sālehh Shanooda, became Moslems,
and uttered the two testimonies before the Emir Karm
Illah (who received their profession of faith).</p>

<p>After which all (the property) which was in the stores
of the Mudiriyeh, situated in the seat (thereof) and elsewhere,
became the property of the Treasury of Islām,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
as stated in the letters of the Emir Karm Illah sent to his
Highness.</p>

<p>And we pray God Most High, to whom be praise, that
He may soon grant us the favour of a journey (Hejira) to
the honoured place, that we may be blessed with sight
of his Excellency the Mahdi, and that we may be
included in the number of the warriors on the way (for
the truth) of God.</p>

<p>I send from me to their Excellencies (the Hanifs) the
nobles, and Emirs, and friends, and acquaintances who
fight for God, thousands of salaams of God so long as
I live.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">From the servant of his Lord, the Fakir, Karam Illah, Sheikh
Mohammed at Bahr el Gazelle to the relation of the Mahdi and
Emir of the army of the Mahdi, the Khalif Abdallah Ben of the
Seyyed Mohammed. May his glory be prolonged.</p>

<p class="p1">After paying our dutiful salutations and respectful compliments,
if you inquire about us (we can say) all praise to
the Most High, all is well, and I have the honour to
announce to you we have captured a large number of
(female) slaves as booty; and that about 1360 head of
slaves have already been sent to Shakka,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> including 200<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
slaves of Kanâwi (of) Alyoo, which family passes to the
Moslem Treasury (<i>i.e.</i> their value); and this (was done)
in three divisions the first time (under convoy of) the Fakir
Ahhmed Mohammed, the Shakiyi; the second (party)
which is considered the most numerous, (under convoy of)
our brother Mohammed Sheikh Mohammed Karkasâwi, and
the third under convoy of the conductor Mohammed Salehh
et Toom; (being) needed for buying (barter for) horses for
use of our auxiliaries, with the knowledge of our brother
Mohammed el Karkasâwi. And those which may be sent
to your honour to the noble camp (<i>i.e.</i> the Mahdi’s camp),
will be also with his knowledge, as he has already been
appointed from here for that purpose.</p>

<p>Also all the Fakirs, our auxiliaries, have been distributed
in the different zerebas in order to collect the booty. And,
please God, all that can be got will be sent to Shaka
by degrees (as captured). And Mahomed Sheikh Mohammed
Karkasâwi is my brother (son) of my father and
mother&mdash;older than me, and he it is who helped us to take
the town of Bahr Ghazel&mdash;and in consideration of his
good management we have appointed him (to go) to
Shaka to barter slaves for horses. And the slaves which
may be sent to your Honour will be with his knowledge
and by his instructions. And as the slaves taken as booty
are exceedingly numerous in this part, and are continually
arriving at the camp of the Mudir, we are much pressed
in despatching them and in looking after them.</p>

<p>If it is agreeable to your Honour (please) to write to
Sheikh Manzal Hamid, and the sons of Hamad Dodao,
about their gratuitous assistance, and their surrendering
the booty to our brother, Sheikh Mohammed Karkasâwi.
We are at present awaiting the orders of your Excellency,
(whether) to remain here or to come to you, or to wait for
the drying up of the waters of the rain, out of compassion
(in consideration for) the believers (the slaves) who have
little infants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>

<p class="pbq p1">Copy of Telegram from his Excellency Gordon Pasha to his
Excellency Ferratch Ullah Bey, Commandant of Omdurmān.</p>

<p class="p1">Sheikh Mahomed Achmed has sent us a letter to inform
us that Lupton Bey, Mudir of Bahr Gazelle, has surrendered
to him, and that the small steamer in which was
Stewart Pasha has been captured by him, together with
what was therein. And he demands that we should surrender
to him.</p>

<p>But to me it is all one whether Lupton Bey has surrendered
or has not surrendered. And whether he has
captured twenty thousand steamers like the <i>Abbas</i>, or
twenty thousand (officers) like Stewart Pasha (or not); it is
all one to me.</p>

<p>I am here, like iron, and hope to see the newly-arrived
English; and if Mahomed Achmed says that the English
die, it is all the same to me. And you must take
a copy of this and give it to the messenger from Slātin,
and send him out early in the morning, that he may go
to him. It is impossible for me to have any more words
with Mahomed Achmed, only lead; and if Mahomed
Achmed is willing to fight he had better, instead of going
to Omdurmān, go to the White Nile by the moat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span></p>

<p>And after this the messengers whom he wants to send to
us must not come by the Omdurmān; they had better
come by the moat afore-mentioned. And send a literal copy
of this, according to orders&mdash;when it has been sealed by
you&mdash;by the emissary of Slātin Bey to be delivered,
and explain to him that this is by our order.</p>

<p class="p1">To-day was a joyful Sunday! The inhabitants of the
city were stirred with joy when the salvoes of artillery
announced from the fort the approach of the English
relieving army.</p>

<p>Three express messengers brought to General Gordon an
autograph letter from Lord Wolseley from Debbe. Rescue
after all! Long live England!</p>

<p>Now at least the lives of (so many) these thousands will
be saved, even though goods and chattels be lost.</p>

<p>Yesterday the news had been already orally spread of an
army approaching from Dongola, but found no credence,
any more than many other false rumours. It was also
said that the first messenger who left on the 9th for
Dongola had passed Berber without hindrance, and will
probably reach Cairo in safety.</p>

<p>Further, I was able, on the 13th, to speak outside the
city lines with Georgio Calamatino, the letter-carrier of
the Mahdi. He was in dervish dress. I sent the missionaries
100 dollars by him. The Mahdi was then in
Schatt, four hours from Duém, with all the European
prisoners, and among them Slatin, who were enrolled
as dervishes in the armoury. (<i>Secret</i>: the missionaries
of both sexes have accepted [the religion of] Islam. The
six sisters are married to Greeks; only the superior, Don
Luigi Bonorn, remained steadfast, but he is condemned to
martyrdom unless he also apostasizes).</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that soon after the arrival of the
English we may or must remove (emigrate). No one
knows whether they will permanently occupy the country
or only effect the complete evacuation.</p>

<p class="pc1 mid">MANIFESTO OF THE MAHDI TO THE INHABITANTS
OF KARTOUM.</p>


<p class="pn1">In the year 1300.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>

<p>Praise be to God, the bountiful Ruler, and blessing on
our Lord Mahomed and his successors, with peace.</p>

<p>From the servant of his Lord, Mahomed the Mahdi,
son of the Seyyed Abdallah, to his beloved in God the
believers in God, and in His Book (the Koran).</p>

<p>The changes (disturbances) of the times are not hidden
from you, nor the forsaking of the Sunnas; and he who
has the (true) faith and understanding will not be pleased
thereat, but will leave all he needs and his native place
(house and home) in defence of religion and the Sunnas;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
and therefore jealousy for Islam will not delay to possess
in full strength (the heart of) the believer.</p>

<p>Now, O my beloved! as to what the Most High God, to
whom be praise, has willed in His Eternity and in His
decrees to grant to His servant, the humble and lowly, in
(bestowing on him) the great Khalifate:&mdash;</p>

<p>The eminent Lord (Mahomed), on whom be blessing
and peace, several times informed me that I am the Mahdi,
the Expected One, and (appointed) me (as) successor<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> to
himself, on whom be blessing and peace, to sit on his
throne, and (as successors) to their Excellencies the four
Khalifs and Princes<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> (of the Faith), and to El Khudr,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
on whom be peace: And God gave as my helpers, the
angels (who are), the Cherubim, and the saints from Adam
to this our day, and also the believing Jinns;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and in the
hour of battle the eminent Lord, the Bountiful One, on
Whom be blessing and peace, will in person go with them
before my hosts, as also the four Khalifs and the Princes
(of the faith), and El Khudr, on whom be peace.</p>

<p>And He gave me the sword of victory of his Excellency
(Mahomed), on whom be blessing and peace; and it was
made known to me that none of either race, human or Jinn,
can conquer him who has it.</p>

<p>Then said he, on whom be blessing and peace, “God
has given to thee a sign that thou art the Mahdi”; which
(sign) is the mole on my right cheek; and he likewise gave
to me another sign (namely, that) there should go forth
before me in the hour of battle a banner of light, borne by
Azraïl,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> on whom be peace, that by it God should convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
my friends, and terror should fall upon the hearts of my
enemies, and (that) God will destroy whoever should
encounter me in hostility.</p>

<p>Then he, on whom be blessing and peace, said to me:
“Thou art created out of the effulgence of my innermost
heart,” and he to whom happiness (is granted) will believe
I am the Mahdi, the Expected One. But God has put
hypocrisy (wickedness) into the heart of those who love
vain pomp, and they will not believe, being greedy of their
vain pomps.</p>

<p>Then he, on whom be blessing and peace, said: Love
of wealth and pomps cause hypocrisy to spring up in the
heart as water causes the herb to spring up; and it is
found in the Athar (traditional sayings about Mahomed):
If you see worldlings loving this world, charge them with
it. And it is found in some of the ancient books (saying):
Do not ask of me a world intoxicated with love of earthly
things, for it will close against thee the way of my love.
And these (are they who like brigands) stop the way of
(true) service (of God).</p>

<p>And when there came to me, O my beloved, from God
and His prophet the decree of the great Khalifate, He
ordered me (to take my) Hegira<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> (flight) to Jebel Kadeer
close by Masāt, and He commanded me to write thence to
all entrusted with public offices. I wrote thus to the
Emirs and Sheikhs of religion, and the wicked denied (my
mission), but the righteous believed; even those who do
not mind any hardship they may encounter for God, nor
what they fail to attain of their dearest wishes; but steadfastly
regard the promises of the most High God, to Whom
be praise, in which He said that He will reserve that other
world for those who do not desire exaltation in this world,
nor (its) corruptions. Now since it is for God to decree,
and since He has willed to bestow the office of Mahdi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
upon His humble and insignificant servant Mahomed the
Mahdi, the son of the Seyyed Abdallah, it behoves us to
submit to the will of God; and, seeing that it is unanimously
agreed by the present and past generations to
attribute supreme knowledge to God, and as His knowledge,
to Whom be praise, is not limited by control of rules
nor by the knowledge of the malevolent, and since God
will blot out (abrogate) or establish what He wills, and
since He is the source of the Book (the Koran), of which
none can understand anything save what He wills, and
since with Him is the key of the unknown (future),&mdash;none
knows it but He, nor is He to be questioned as to what He
does,&mdash;He creates what He will,&mdash;He chooses and bestows
His mercy on whom He will. Sheikh Mohi ed Deen Ibn
el Arabi especially says in his commentary on the glorious
Koran that knowledge of the Mahdi is like knowledge of
the hour (of resurrection), and that hour none knoweth
but God most High. And Sheikh Ahmed Ibn Edrees
said, Fourteen generations of the generations of the people
of God have denied the (coming of the) Mahdi. Then he
said: He will come forth from a place that they do not
know and in a condition which they will disown.</p>

<p>It is not hidden from your knowledge that the writings
about the (coming of the) Mahdi are among others the
Athar and the Keshef el Ulema and others; and the
conclusion of them all (is), and I understand from them,
that God will blot out (abrogate) what passages He will,
and some of these are the Hadiths (traditional sayings),
and among them Ed Dha’eef and El Maktooa’ and El
Mansookh and El Mowdhooa’. The Hadith Ed Dha’eef is
superseded by the Hadith El Saheehh word for word. The
Ayat also are replaced by other Ayat.<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> And the truth as
to this is not known save to people of deep thought and
insight.</p>

<p>Further, this is what the eminent Lord (Mahomed), on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
whom be blessing and peace, said to me, “He who doubts
that thou art the Mahdi has blasphemed God and His
prophet.” This he, blessing and peace be upon him,
declared to me thrice.</p>

<p>All that I have told you about my succession to the office
of Mahdi was told to me by the eminent Lord (Mohammed),
on whom be blessing and peace, when I was awake and in
perfect health, free from all transgressions of the law, not in
sleep nor in (a state of) hallucination, or drunkenness or
madness, but accounted to be of sound mind, following the
traditions of the prophet, on whom be blessing and peace,
in ordering what he ordered and forbidding what he
forbade.</p>

<p>And my Hegira (flight) to the aforesaid places was
necessary, according to the Book (the Koran) and to the
Sunnas. The Most High God has said, “Those who have
had to flee (make a Hegira) for the sake of God after
having been persecuted; He will give them good things
in this world, and the reward in the next will be greater.
And He, on whom is blessing and peace, said, ‘One who
has fled from land to land, even though it be but a hand-breath
of land, has deserved Paradise, and has become (in
so doing) a partaker with<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Abraham, the friend of God and
of Mahomed, on whom be blessing and peace.’”</p>

<p>Thus also in other passages of the Hadiths.</p>

<p>And the duty of listening to God and His prophet is
binding. The Most High God has said, “Follow the way
of those who are sincere to Me.”</p>

<p>If you have understood this, we order all the chosen ones
to flee (make their Hegira) unto us for the Jehād (holy
war) in the cause of God, to the nearest town, because God
Most High has said, “Slay the infidels who are nearest to
you”; and he who holds back from this has come within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
the threat uttered by the Most High. Say if your fathers,
your sons, your brethren, your wives, your tribes, the wealth
you have gained, the merchandise you are in fear of losing,
or the dwellings you delight in are dearer to you than God
and His prophet and the Jehād (holy war) in His cause,
then wait till God shall come with His sentence (against
you). (So far) the Aya (verse).</p>

<p>The Most High has also said, “O you who have believed,
why do you cleave to the earth when called upon to fly (to
the war) for God? Do you love the life of this world better
than that of the next? But the possessions of this world
will be less than nothing in the other world.”</p>

<p>The Most High has also said, “O you who have believed,
why do you cleave to the earth when called upon to fly (to
the war) for God? Do you love the life of this world better
than that of the next? But the possessions of this world
will be less than nothing in the other world.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>He has also said, “Seek not to fly.” He will torment you
with eternal torments, and will accept others in your place.</p>

<p>Now, if you have understood the foregoing, hasten to
us, and fear none save God, for fear of the creature shows
lack of trust and confidence in God, from which may God
preserve (us).</p>

<p>The Most High has said, “Fear ye not man, but fear ye
Me;” and the Most High has said, “Dread them not, but
dread Me, if ye be believers.”</p>

<p>The Most High has said, “God is worthy to be feared”;
and especially because God has promised in His precious
Book (the Koran) victory to him who contends for the
faith.</p>

<p>The Most High has said, “If you fight for God, He will
fight for you and establish your goings.”</p>

<p>And the Most High has said, “If you do not fight for
him (the Mahdi) God fighteth for him.” Because you have
known this, if you do not respond to him who calls (in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
name) of God and hasten to fight for the faith, you must
receive punishment from God, inasmuch as you are the
light of creation, its strength, and its head.</p>

<p>Whoever among you is anxious about his faith and
zealous for the command of his Lord will answer the call,
and will join with those that fight for the religion of God.</p>

<p>Be it known unto you that I am of the family of the
prophet of God, on whom be blessing and peace. My
father is a Hhusni on his father’s side; and his mother, and
my mother likewise, on the side of both father and mother
(are) Abbāssides, and God knows that I am of the blood
of Hussein, and these excellent indications will suffice for
him who has been touched by His grace and (by) the faith.</p>

<p>It will not be wonderful if some do see and do not
believe it.</p>

<p>Fear God and join the righteous, and help one another in
righteousness, and in the fear of God and in the Jehād
(holy war) in the cause of God, and stand firm within the
boundaries of God, for he who transgresses those boundaries
will injure himself.</p>

<p>Know that all things are in the hand of God. Leave all
to Him and rely on Him. He who makes God his support
has been guided into the straight way.</p>

<p class="pr4">Peace (be with you).</p>

<p class="pn1">In the year 1300.</p>

<p>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.
Praise be to God, the Bountiful Ruler, and blessing and
blessing and peace on our Lord Mahomed and his
successors.</p>

<p>From the slave of his Lord, the Imām Mohamed the
Mahdi, the son of the Seyyed Abdallah, to all his beloved
in God the believers, men and women, in God and in His
Book.</p>

<p>What I have to inform you is that the world is the abode

believers, and that the other (world) is better, and (is)
enduring, and that is the abode of those who fear God.</p>

<p>Fear God and do<span class="ls4">....</span></p>

<p>This Manifesto is written on four sides of a two-leaved sheet of
paper, and breaks off abruptly, “and do” being written at bottom
as catch-word for the next page.</p>

<p>Specially to be noticed is the attempt made to forestall the
objections of those who would see that this man contradicts well
known passages in the writings which Moslems hold to be authoritative.
Mahomed Achmet boldly declares all such passages
to be either abrogated or superseded, or unintelligible save to
those to whom deep thought and insight are given!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear General Gordon</span>,</p>

<p class="pi6">Please inform me by this present messenger, who is
paid to return, who were on board the steamer that came
down from Kartoum. I am sorry to say, whoever they
were, they have fallen into the hands of Suleiman Wady
Goun, Sheikh of the Minassir, and have, I am afraid, been
killed. Lord Wolseley is now at Wady Halfa, and it is
expected this expedition will definitely start from Dongola
on or about the 1st November. Special boats are coming
out from England for the passage up the Nile.</p>

<p>There are a considerable number of troops now at
Dongola. I am instructed by Sir Evelyn Baring to send
you the following telegram from the Austrian Consul-General:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span></p>

<p>“Caire, 1<sup>er</sup> Oct.&mdash;Je vous remercie, de tout cœur, des
nouvelles que vous avez bien voulu me donner. J’ai fait
des démarches pour faciliter le voyage de notre consul de
Berbér jusqu’au Caire, mais on m’assure que les chemins de
Berber à Debbeh ne sont pas libres; en tous cas, je vous
recommande chaudement la sécurité personnelle de notre
consul et des sujets Austro-Hongrois et Allemands. Je
serai très heureux d’avoir des nouvelles directes de Monsieur
Hansall.”</p>

<p>I also enclose two letters that have arrived here for you.</p>

<p>I hope you have received some of my previous letters; I
have received none from you in reply.</p>

<p class="pi4">I had the honour to write you on the 10th of

<p>On the 22nd of April I wired to Earl Granville: “For
Heaven’s sake, help Gordon, Kartoum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span></p>

<p>And confirmed this despatch with the following letter:&mdash;</p>

afternoon: ‘For Heaven’s sake, help Gordon, Kartoum.’</p>

<p>“Your Lordship may be kind enough to excuse such a
telegram.</p>

<p>“As I am an admirer of Gordon, and as he had the kindness
to do his best to become liberated my brother Gottfried
Roth, who is said prisoner of the Mahdi, and to whom
your Lordship congratulated when he captured at Sint a
band of slaveholders with several hundred slaves some
years ago, I considered it a duty to do something too for
Gordon. And so the idea to wire to your Lordship, who
perhaps may be able in consequence of your powerful position
to let have Gordon what he wants.</p>

<p>“I have the honour, &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p class="p1">As it is known to you that the object of the coming of
your Excellency to this part, and of your going to the
Soudan, is only the evacuation of that neighbourhood and
the withdrawal of our troops, now found there, with the
Government officials of the realm, and the bringing hither
of those inhabitants of that part who may desire to come
together with their belongings, we trust that your Excellency
will take every care in the fulfilment of this Commission
by employing the best means and arrangements which
may be necessary for the safety of those troops and employés,
and inhabitants and merchants, both native and
foreign, who may desire to come to this part.</p>

<p>Then, after completion of this (business), you will adopt
the necessary means and arrangements indispensable for
framing a firm government in the Soudan provinces, that
there may be continuance of order in that part, and that
there may be security from the misfortunes (which must
befall) the ignorant populace (left) without a ruler. And I
rely on your understanding and courage, to which is intrusted
the carrying out of this commission in the manner
desired.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">(Seal of Mahomet Towfik).</p>

<p class="p1">From the Khedive of Egypt and its dependencies to all
the Ulema, Judges, Notables, Sheikhs of Arabs of villages,
Merchants, and all inhabitants, both Arabs and domesticated
people in the Soudan countries, greeting.</p>

<p>It is known to all that when my grandfather <span class="smcap">Jantimgan
Mahomed Ali</span> took the reigns of Government of the
Lands of Egypt, he began to spread knowledge and education
and enlarge the sphere of agriculture and commerce
throughout the same, and increase the means of wealth of
the inhabitants, until Egypt was considered a well-cultivated
and civilised country. After that he saw the necessity
of taking (or opening up) the Soudan Region, to
spread out the lights of civilisation therein&mdash;and God
Almighty prospered him in that enterprise. From that
time until now these regions have not ceased to grow in
prosperity, until towns and market cities were established
and enlarged, and commerce grew, and the inhabitants
became enlightened by the means of commerce and agriculture.
By a comparison of the condition of the Soudan
Regions before these conquests, with their condition after
it, it will clearly appear that they progressed and advanced
greatly during the latter time. The minds of the people
were enlightened by seeing their own interest and prosperity.
This was the only purpose which moved our
grandfather aforesaid to take these regions. But the
great distance that lies between me and you caused a
disintegration which had for its result the rising and rebelling
of some disturbers against my Government. This
rebellion caused great losses of money and men without
any fruits at all; and the Land of Egypt sustained thereby
very heavy burdens. Therefore I have concluded to give
back again independence to the ancient families of the
Kings of the Soudan Regions. And, as I know that His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
Excellency Gordon Pasha, during his stay among you,
seeing that you witnessed the good results of his efforts for
the quiet and prosperity of the country. Therefore, and
also because he is deemed an able man of politics and of
your judgment, and desirous of your welfare, We have
appointed him to proceed to those regions as our representative,
with full authority to agree with in establishing a
peaceable and amicable way of withdrawing from those
parts, and bringing away the officials of my Government
and the troops with their belongings and the property of
my Government, so that the departure from you may be
brought about in perfect security. I therefore ask of all
who bear arms to throw the same away, and to endeavour,
with all diligence and quiet and peacefulness, to form their
own Government of the future within my boundaries, and
to work for the prosperity of their countries, and the
security of the roads at all times; so that between us and
them the bonds of communication shall continue to exist
and so that commerce shall be rendered easy, which is
conducive to wealth, and so that civilisation and luxury
may be furthered. And thus the bonds of friendship may
be kept up, as is dictated by the laws of humanity.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">Written on the 28th day of Rabia the First, 1301.<br />
(January 26th, 1884).</p>

<p class="pc2 lmid"><span class="smcap">Notice published by Gordon</span>.</p>

<p class="p1">Formerly the Government had decided to transport the
Egyptians down to Cairo, and abandon the Soudan: and
in fact some of them had been sent down during the time
of Hussein Pasha Yusri, as you yourselves saw. On our
arrival at Kartoum, we, on account of pity for you, and in
order not to let your country be destroyed, we communicated
with the Khedive of Egypt, our Effendi, concerning
the importance and the inexpediency of abandoning it.
Whereupon, the orders for abandoning the Soudan were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
cancelled; and serious attention was turned, and all energy
was directed towards smothering the disturbances and
driving away the disturbers: therefore sufficient troops
were appointed, both cavalry and infantry some time ago;
and indeed they have reached Dongola and started in three
divisions, one under the leader of the army and the Mudir
of Dongola is coming on to Berber: the second division
has the Sheikh of the Hawaweer, and is coming by way of
Hobaji: the third division, with Sheikh Saleh, son of Salim,
Sheikh of the Kababeesh, is coming to Metemma. Each
one of these divisions is alone sufficient to oppose all the
rebels. They will soon be in Kartoum. We shall increase
in defence of the Soudan until the arrival of the troops
here, as is the will of the Khedive’s iradé issued to us on
the 14th September, 1884. The Ulema and teachers of
Kartoum had presented a telegram to the Khedive asking
for reinforcements&mdash;now an iradé of the Khedive has been
issued to them, a copy of which is given here above. Be
therefore fully reassured as to yourselves and your families,
and all your possessions in your houses, taking no heed of
what has occurred in the past. If God will in the next few
days the siege will be raised, and your alarm will pass
away. Know also that if Mohammed Achmet should call
upon me for three years to surrender Kartoum I will not
listen to him, but will protect your lives and families and
possessions with all energy and stedfastness.</p>

<p class="pc1 reduct">Translation of a letter addressed to General Gordon by the Kalifa
Abdulla Mahommed, 10. 12. 85.</p>


<p class="p1">In the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate.
Praise be to the Bountiful God, and blessings be upon our
Lord Mahomed and upon his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>We, the servant of God <span class="smcap">Abdallah Mohammed
Jifarah</span>, one of the governors of the Mahdi, on whom be
peace, on the East, to Gordon, the Pasha of <span class="smcap">Kartoum</span>.
You have paid no attention to the counsel and reasoning
repeatedly sent to you, but have increased in folly; and
the numerous kindly admonitions have only made you
more haughty and wayward; because truth enlightens the
breasts of believers and only increases the oppressors in
their degenerations. Your letter has reached us, in which
you deceived the population, saying that the British reinforcement
is coming to you in three divisions, and that it
will soon reach you and give you victory; thus your letter
betrays the greatness of your fear, and anxiety, and alarm,
as in your deceit you have caught hold of spider-web ropes
and have feared to die at our hands; thou must inevitably
die, O thou heathen! These promises you have been
holding them out since last year to the inhabitants of
<span class="smcap">Kartoum</span>, and have been promising them that the English
will come soon. Your promise has only increased their
sorrows; and now that you are in straits, and that evil is
coming upon you, you are practising deceit from the
interior of your den (<i>sic</i>) in which God has imprisoned you,
upon him who is in the land of peace and crowned with
exceeding much honour, and who is able to get the news
of riders arriving from the remotest regions. I ask, do
the sounds, winged and free, unfettered, need news from
the like of thee in the sea of billows covered by waves
upon wave, above which are clouds of darkness piled one
over the other. Know thou, O thou enemy of God, that
the true news is with us and not with you, and that the
news which has reached us contains nothing to cheer thy
eye or uphold thy power; on the contrary, there is no
escape for thee from death at our hands, and from death
by lack of food. But it is no wonder that you deny the
Mahdiship, for you did not believe in the Apostleship of
Mahomed; but the wonder is that the learned men of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
wickedness, who are raised to prominent positions by you,
and whom God has left to go astray, and whose hearts He
has closed, whose ears He has sealed, and over whose eyes
He has put a veil, since they have been satisfied with you
as a leader, and have taken you as a teacher, and have
waged war against Believers, and seek victory to those
who believe in more than one God, as though they had
not heard the word of God. “If you wage war, war
will come upon you, and if you end war it is better for you,
and if you return He will return, and God is with
the Believers.” Do you not know, O you wicked learned
men, that he who secedes from the Commonwealth has
slipped away from the Faith, just as a hair is drawn out
from the lump of dough? If you, by reason of your love
of office and by reason of your association with darkness,
are in doubt as to this Imàn, are you also in doubt as to
the Apostleship of Mahommed, on whom be peace and
blessings, that you followed his enemies the evil unbelievers,
and have made your rulers in preference to the sons
of Islam and desire them to be victorious? Have you not
heard the word of God which says, “O ye who have
believed, take not my enemy and your enemy to be rulers,
nor bestow on them your affection, and I know what you
have hidden and what you have made known; and he
among you who does this has strayed away to the wrong
path.” God also says, “O ye who have believed do not
take your fathers and your brothers to be your chiefs if
they prefer unbelief to faith.” God also says, “you will
not find a people who believes in God and in the Last
Day that will befriend those who stray from God and the
Prophet, even though they be their fathers, brothers, or
relations.” But you, you have taken the Christians to be
your rulers when you have no doubt as to their heathenism.
Look therefore to yourselves after these quotations; do
you consider it to be counted of the company of Believers?
(<i>sic</i>). It is strange how you frighten the people, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
the English are coming, and how you think that the Allies
will be affected by your false rumours. No, by God! even
though swarms of English and others should come, this
would only increase the faith of the Allies, and their
steadfastness would grow in the labour of the siege until
God shall make you taste confusion and destruction.
Take warning by those who are like you if you are children
of intelligence. Before you the people of Obeid were
longing for reinforcements like the longing of the thirsty
for water; and they too were writing deceitful and cheering
letters, more than you have done; and, nevertheless, you
have heard what befel them.</p>

<p>If you are content to remain as you are, then prepare for
what shall come: but if you knock at the door of repentance,
peradventure it may be opened unto you.</p>

<p>Peace be upon those who follow after the right way.</p>

<p class="p1">We make bold to present our humble thanks to our
Sovereign the Khedive. The enemy drew near to <span class="smcap">Kartoum</span>
and besieged it, and our lives were in our throats,
and we had no more patience, and words cannot describe
our miserable condition. Then the Governor-Generalship
was conferred upon <span class="smcap">H. E. Gordon</span> Pasha, and on his
arrival he bestowed all kinds of favours and conceded all
that had been demanded, and took all precautions and
brought order out of chaos. And although <span class="smcap">Kartoum</span> was

in by reason of the impossibility of sending you reinforcements,
and help up till now on account of circumstances.
But we are very glad because you are still safe, and the

reinforcements will soon reach you, and you shall be rewarded.
We hope you will exercise all diligence in
upholding the honour of Government. The difficulties are
being overcome and the time of relief is at hand by the

The military, civilians, Ulemas, inhabitants and settlers in
Kartoum telegraphed on August 19th to the Khedive as follows:
“Weakened and reduced to extremities, God in His mercy sent
Gordon Pasha to us in the midst of our calamities of the siege,
and we should all have perished of hunger and been destroyed.
But we, sustained by his intelligence and great military skill, have
been preserved in Kartoum until now.”&mdash;<i>Egypt, No. 35</i>, <i>p.</i> 112;

In this passage we have an example of the old and perfect
fairness with which General Gordon dealt with others. Before
allowing Mustapha Faki, the neutral, to join his ranks and aid
him against the Mahdi, he must first himself be satisfied that such
a step would not endanger Faki Mustapha’s life. Success or
failure was still doubtful. This, of course, he could not tell
Mustapha, but would it be right and just to use him while such
a doubt existed? Gordon was of opinion that it would not,
and thus he bade Mustapha wait events, and do for him that
only which involved no risks.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

At first sight there might seem something of a contradiction
in these sentiments, but, when weighed, they will be found consistent
and sound. They convey an idea which was constantly
at work in General Gordon’s mind, and this to the effect that man
should make every effort towards the attainment of perfection, and
then, and not till then, leave the issue to God; that he should, in
fact, draw on all earthly resources&mdash;as the instrument of God&mdash;and
that, these exhausted, he should then look to Heaven for aid
not to be drawn from earth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

“Surviving Soudanese declared that the two Pashas in command
charged back into their own square; the soldiers, recognising
them, opened their ranks to let them through; and into the gap
thus made the rebel cavalry followed. The treachery, doubtless
pre-arranged, was complete in its success, but retribution was close
at hand. When the battle was over these two traitors, Said and
Hassan, came into Gordon’s tent, and the General offered them
drink. They refused; Gordon’s secretary, divining the reason,
drank first, and the Pashas, who had suspected poison, followed
suit. During the remainder of that day they lay hidden in their
homes, for the soldiers were crying aloud for vengeance, and
would have murdered them at once had they appeared in the
streets. The next day they were tried by court-martial, and
found guilty of communication with the enemy and of having
treacherously murdered their own men. In the house of Hassan
a great store of rifles and ammunition was discovered; and it was
proved that both he and his colleague had stolen the two months’
pay given to the troops on account of six months’ arrears. They
had also taken into the field with them seventy rounds of cannon
ammunition, instead of eight, the usual number, so that the rebels’
guns might be well supplied for future attacks on Kartoum. The
trial was long and patient, but the verdict was apparent from the
beginning. Hassan and Said were found guilty, and on the
same evening, amid expressions of universal delight, they were
shot by the men they had betrayed.”&mdash;<i>The Story of Chinese

Lord Granville on May 17, 1884, instructed Mr. Egerton to
communicate the following message from Her Majesty’s Government
to General Gordon:&mdash;</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Having regard to the time which has elapsed, Her Majesty’s
Government desire to add to their communication of the 23rd
April as follows:&mdash;As the original plan for the evacuation of the
Soudan has been dropped, and as aggressive operations cannot
be undertaken with the countenance of Her Majesty’s Government,
General Gordon is enjoined to consider and either to
report upon, or, if feasible, to adopt, at the first proper moment,
measures for his own removal and for that of the Egyptians at
Kartoum who have suffered for him or who have served him
faithfully, including their wives and children, by whatever route
he may consider best, having especial regard to his own safety
and that of the other British subjects.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“With regard to the Egyptians above referred to, General
Gordon is authorised to make free use of money rewards or
promises at his discretion. For example, he is at liberty to assign
to Egyptian soldiers at Kartoum sums for themselves and for
persons brought with them per head, contingent on their safe
arrival at Korosko, or whatever point he may consider a place of
safety; or he may employ and pay the tribes in the neighbourhood
to escort them. Her Majesty’s Government presume that
the Soudanese at Kartoum are not in danger. In the event of
General Gordon having dispatched any persons or agents to other
points, he is authorised to spend any money required for the
purpose of recalling them or securing their safety.”&mdash;<i>Egypt, 22,

“The danger to be feared is not that the Mahdi will march
northward through Wady Halfa; on the contrary, it is very
improbable that he will ever go so far north. The danger is
altogether of a different nature. It arises from the influence
which the spectacle of a conquering Mahommedan Power,
established close to your frontiers, will exercise upon the population
which you govern. In all the cities in Egypt it will be felt
that what the Mahdi has done they may do; and, as he has
driven out the intruder and the infidel, they may do the same.
Nor is it only England that has to face this danger. The success
of the Mahdi has already excited dangerous fermentation in
Arabia and Syria. Placards have been posted in Damascus
calling upon the population to rise and drive out the Turks. If
the whole of the Eastern Soudan is surrendered to the Mahdi,
the Arab tribes on both sides the Red Sea will take fire. In
self-defence the Turks are bound to do something to cope with
so formidable a danger, for it is quite possible that if nothing is
done the whole of the Eastern Question may be reopened by the
triumph of the Mahdi.”&mdash;<i>General Gordon’s views, as expressed to

“Ismail, the ex-Khedive, fully considered that to maintain
his hold of the Soudan, he must improve his communications with
it and Egypt proper. Unfortunately, in his wish to bring the Soudan
trade down the Nile through Egypt proper, he was led to abandon
its natural outlet by the route from Berber to Suakin, across the
280-mile desert, and determined to make a railway through the
desert along the Nile past the Cataracts from Wady Halfa to
Hanneck, a distance of 180 miles. Contracts were made, and
some £450,000 were spent on the line; but financial difficulties
arose, and in 1877 it came to a standstill some fifty or sixty
kilometres south of Wady Halfa. It was evident that on this grand
scale the continuation of the line could not be hoped for, so I studied
the question. There was the line made from Wady Halfa for say
fifty miles; and therefore 130 miles remained to be got over before
this barrier of desert was passed. By the researches of Colonel
Mason and Mr. Gooding, and also by my own personal examination,
the river for this 130 miles was shown to be not continuously
encumbered by rocks. There were, as it were, long strips of open,
water between the ridges of rocks,&mdash;one of these strips was forty
miles in length. Now steamers built in England had in full flood
been hauled up every one of these ridges, and had thus been brought
to Kartoum and had plied to Gondokoro. My idea was to bring up
small steamers during high Nile, place them on all the open strips of
water of any reasonable extent; and thus work them from ridge
to ridge in these open spaces. I proposed further to have only
one crew, and to ship them from steamer to steamer so as to save
expense. At those places where the ridge was of any great length,
I proposed to use tramways to get over the space between the
debarking landing-place of one open water-way to the embarking
wharf of the other open water-way. Thus, by using the water-way
where open, and tramways where the river was encumbered, I
should get over these 130 miles. I calculated that the cost of all
this work, steamers, and tramways, &amp;c., would be £70,000, while
the railway, if carried, would have cost over a million and a half.
However, the revolts, troubles of different kinds, and other
things, prevented this being carried out, and the controllers would
not take it up; so, after an expense of nearly half-a-million, the
railway exists with its end <i>en l’air</i>, with its valuable stores perishing,
while Egypt proper has no more hold over the Soudan than was
had by Ancient Egypt.”&mdash;<i>See “Colonel Gordon in Central

The following extract from Herodotus is pasted on the
opposite side of page in the original journal:&mdash;“The spies having
seen everything returned home; and when they reported all they
had passed, Cambyses marched against the Ethiopians without
making any provision for the subsistence of his army, or once
considering that he was going to carry his arms to the remotest
parts of the world; but as a madman and not in possession of
his senses, as soon as he heard the reports of the Icthyophagi
he set out on his march ... but before the army had passed
over a fifth part of the way all the provisions were exhausted, and
after the provisions the beasts of burden were eaten. Now if
Cambyses had then led back his army he would have proved
himself a wise man. He, however, went on; but afterwards
none, except the Ammonians, and those who have heard their
reports, are able to give account of them; for they neither reached
the Ammonians or returned back, but the report was that heaps
of sand covered them over and they disappeared.” General
Gordon has written against this extract:&mdash;“Hicks’ army disappeared.

“I am strongly against any permanent retention of the
Soudan, but I think we ought to leave it with decency, and
give the respectable people a man to lead them, around whom
they can rally, and we ought to support that man by money and
by opening road to Berber. Pray do not consider me in any
way to advocate retention of Soudan; I am quite averse to it,
but you must see that you could not recall me nor could I possibly
obey until the Cairo employés get out from all the places. I
have named men to different places, thus involving them with
Mahdi; how could I look the world in the face if I abandoned
them and fled? As a gentleman, could you advise this course?
It may have been a mistake to send me up, but having been
done I have no option but to see evacuation through, for even
if I was mean enough to escape I have no power to do so. You
can easily understand this; would you do so? If you were the

Abdel Kader was then Minister of War. In March 1882, he
was appointed to succeed Raouf Pasha as Governor-General of
the Soudan, and on the 11th of May he reached Kartoum and
assumed his duties. He carried on an active campaign against
the Mahdi until March 26th, 1883, when Al-ed-Din Pasha
was publicly proclaimed at Kartoum, Governor-General of the
Soudan, in his place. In January 1884 Abdel Kader was
selected by the Egyptian Government as their envoy to Kartoum.
He at first accepted the position and then declined it.
Upon this the Egyptian Government requested Her Majesty’s
Government to select a well-qualified British officer to go to
Kartoum instead of Abdel Kader. General Gordon was the
officer selected. Thus, in suggesting Abdel Kader as his successor,
General Gordon was suggesting the very man whom he
had succeeded.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

“I have ascertained within the last few weeks that the principal
agent in the surrender of the city was not Ferratch Pasha, as
originally stated, but a certain civilian exile from Egypt who had
acted at one time under Arabi as Secretary of the Ministry of
Marine. I know the history of this man well, and can vouch for
its accuracy, as I often heard it at Cairo when I was there. Four
years or so ago Awaan was an honest and zealous employé in
the Cadastral Survey under Sir Auckland Colvin&mdash;a service which
of all others under the Control was the most inefficient, and is
now acknowledged to have been so. Awaan, provoked at the
waste and mismanagement, one day had the temerity to draw up
a memorandum of what he knew and to send it to his chief. The
answer was his dismissal. He then appealed to the native press&mdash;for
there was some liberty in those days&mdash;and his grievance
made him a hero; and when Arabi came to power he gave him
this place as secretary, which he held at Alexandria down to the
bombardment. I never heard of his taking any prominent part
in the politics of that eventful time, but on Sir Auckland Colvin’s
landing he was among the first persons arrested. Lord Charles
Beresford tried him by one of his courts-martial and found him
guilty of exciting to rebellion, or some such charge. He was
handed over to the Circassian tender mercies, and, after seventy-four
days in irons in the terrible Borgho prison, he was exiled to
Kartoum. He was clearly a political prisoner if ever there was
one; and when Lord Dufferin promised us the amnesty at the
compromise of Arabi’s trial, I wrote to him recommending
Awaan’s case to his special attention, and I have his answer,
with a memorandum, curiously enough, by the very Sir Charles
Wilson who was afterwards to reap such bitter disappointment at
his hands. But Lord Dufferin declined to interfere, and Awaan
was left at Kartoum to his revenge. On January 26 it was he
who, with the English again at his gates, negotiated its surrender
to its Arab deliverer.”&mdash;<i>Mr. Wilfred Blunt in a letter to the

had been shut up with them escaped here without arms, saying
that the Shaggyeh had gone over to the enemy, while others
would come from them beseeching for aid. I am glad to say that
without exception the people of the town and the troops have

most significant sign to the people in this town and in the
provinces that no assistance is likely to come to Kartoum.
Under these circumstances, what do you recommend me to say in
order to neutralise the ill-effects of their departure?&mdash;<i>General
Gordon to Sir Evelyn Baring, Kartoum, March 9, 1884</i>, 11.30 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>
<i>Egypt, No. 12 (1884), Inclosure in No. 242</i>.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“You know exactly the position of the different garrisons so
far as I can explain it, and that there is no probability of the
people rallying round me, or of paying any attention to my
Proclamation.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“If you mean to make the proposed diversion to Berber (of
British troops), and to accept my proposal as to Zebehr, to instal
him in the Soudan and evacuate, then it is worth while to hold on
to Kartoum.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“If, on the other hand, you determine on neither of these
steps, then I can see no use in holding on to Kartoum, for it is
impossible for me to help the other garrisons, and I shall only be
sacrificing the whole of the troops and <i>employés</i> here.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“In this latter case, your instructions to me had better be that
I should evacuate Kartoum, and, with all the employés and
troops, remove the seat of government to Berber. You would
understand that such a step would mean the sacrificing of all
outlying places except Berber and Dongola.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“You must give a prompt reply to this, as even the retreat to
Berber may not be in my power in a few days; and, even if
carried out at once, the retreat will be of extreme difficulty.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“I should have to leave large stores, and nine steamers which
cannot go down. Eventually, some question would arise at
Berber and Dongola, and I may utterly fail in getting the Cairo
employés to Berber.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“If I attempt it, I could be responsible only for the attempt to
do so.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“Once the Mahdi is in Kartoum, operations against him will
be very arduous, and will not serve Sennaar and Kassala.”</p>
<p class="pfr2 p1">“<i>Kartoum, March 9, 1884</i>, 11.40 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span><br /></p>
<p class="pfc4">“If the immediate evacuation of Kartoum is determined upon,
irrespective of outlying towns, I would propose to send down all
the Cairo employés and white troops with Colonel Stewart to
Berber, where he would await your orders. I would also ask
Her Majesty’s Government to accept the resignation of my commission,
and I would take all steamers and stores up to the
Equatorial and Bahr Gazelle Provinces, and consider those
provinces as under the King of the Belgians.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“You would be able to retire all Cairo employés and white
troops with Stewart from Berber to Dongola, and thence to Wady
Halfa.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“If you, therefore, determine on the immediate evacuation of
Kartoum, this is my idea. If you object, tell me.</p>
<p class="pfc4">“It is the only solution that I can see if the immediate
evacuation of Kartoum, irrespective of the outlying towns, is

 In his ‘Wild Tribes of the Soudan,’ Mr. F. L. James gives
an account of how he and his party were treated by Ala-ed-Deen
and the Bey at Senheit. This Bey was no other than Ferratch
Pasha, who is said to have opened the gates of Kartoum. “We
had engaged camels at Senheit,” says Mr. James, “for some
weeks’ shooting in the vicinity. On our return, a steamer was
leaving Massowah for Suez, which we could only catch by taking
the same camels on to the coast.  Our Shaggyeh drivers objected,
saying the road to the sea was out of their country, and
their camels were tired&mdash;perfectly valid excuses.  We offered
them half as much again as the proper fare, but they still demurred,
fearing that the Governor of Massowa would take their
camels, make them carry for the Government, and probably
never pay them. On obtaining a letter for the Bey at Senheit
(Ferratch), asking (as we fondly imagined) Ala-ed-Deen, who
was at that time Governor of Massowah, to let them go free, they
consented to accompany us. On our arrival we presented the
letter, which, we found, merely stated that the garrison of Senheit
was in want of salt, and that he had better load up the camels
with some, and return them to him.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

“King John issued an edict that if any of his subjects were
found smoking they should lose hand and foot. General Gordon
in his notes on Abyssinia in 1879, said: ‘I write in haste, but I
will sum up my impression of Abyssinia. The king is rapidly
growing mad. He cuts off the noses of those who take snuff,
and the lips of those who smoke.  The king is hated more than
Theodore was. Cruel to a degree, he does not, however, take
life. He cuts off the feet and hands of people who offend him.
He puts out their eyes by pouring hot tallow into their ears. No
one can travel without the king’s order if he is a foreigner. You
can buy nothing without his order; no one will shelter you without
his order&mdash;in fact no more complete despotism could exist.’</p>

by this statement, that, in the position of a Major-General in H.M.

were he ordered to do so, though such an order would be most
unwelcome; but that he would do nothing of the kind until some
one replaced him as Governor-General. He is really applying to
himself the remarks he made a few pages back: “In military
affairs it is different: one is ordered to go here and there, and

<p class="pfc4">“I have the honour to report to your Lordship that, although
I did not specially consult General Gordon on the subject of
sending British troops to Assouan, he telegraphs to me that if

It was about this date that the recall of Lord Wolseley was

this rumoured recall was officially contradicted. The ‘Times,’
however, said: “We have every confidence in the veracity and

It is interesting to note how often General Gordon breaks
away abruptly from a subject which is irritating him, and deals with
one which has a touch of humour in it. He never does this when
he is discussing or explaining any particular point; it is only
when he is thoroughly annoyed with his subject that he suddenly
leaves it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

It is impossible to read this without a feeling of admiration
for the thorough way in which General Gordon examined into the
minutest details of everything himself. Every precaution human

Compare General Gordon’s account with the account given
by the Mudir of Dongola:&mdash;“A certain Faki Walad Ahmet, who
appears trustworthy, has arrived here, stating that he has heard
that after General Gordon’s return to Kartoum a steamer, with
forty men on board, partly Europeans and partly Egyptians,
besides five negroes and three servants, arrived at Salamat, where
she ran aground, but did not founder. The population, aware of
the fate of Berber, and being much alarmed, several persons from
the steamer went ashore in order to reassure the natives, declaring
that they had not come to make war, but to purchase camels in
order to cross the desert to Merawi. The Sheikhs Soliman and
Abu Noman, and the uncle of Faki Osman, agreed to see to their
conveyance, and provided a guide, who was to conduct the party.
Those on board were so pleased with this attention that they
presented one of the Sheikhs with a gold sword, the uncle with a
silver sword, and the guide with a rich dress, whereupon the
Sheikhs requested them to leave the steamer and accept their
hospitality until preparations had been completed for crossing
the desert. The invitation was accepted, and the party entered
a house, where they were all massacred. The Sheikhs afterwards
returned to the steamer and killed most of them on board. Of
forty persons only fourteen were spared, and these were taken
prisoners.” The Sub-Mudir, not knowing if there were any
Europeans among the survivors, had sent messengers for further
intelligence.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

General Gordon has pasted cuttings from the paper to which he

lowness of the Nile, no confidence is felt in the practicability of
hauling boats over the cataracts till the end of September.”

At this point General Gordon refers to the newspaper
cuttings he has made and pasted in on the opposite page. The
first reference is a comment on a telegram in the <i>Standard</i>, dated
Suakin, August 30th, which runs as follows: “The <i>Jaffariyeh</i>
overtook <i>not far</i> to the <i>south</i> of Suakin the three dhows <i>recently
captured</i> by the rebels. The latter on being overtaken ran the
boats aground, and escaped inland. The crew of the <i>Jaffariyeh</i>
subsequently burned the dhows.” The italics are General Gordon’s.
(<i>b</i>) refers to a further telegram headed “Rebellion in Arabia,”
and dated Constantinople, Sunday night: “Fighting still going on
in the Hedjaz between the Ottoman troops and the Arab tribes
which have revolted against the authority of the Sultan’s Government.
Matters must be considered somewhat serious by the
Porte, for the Government have decided to despatch to the seat
of disturbance further reinforcements of Imperial troops to the
extent of some two thousand, &amp;c.” In an account in a London
paper of the departure of Lords Northbrook and Wolseley,
General Gordon has marked certain penny-a-line passages, and
in all cases where “Gordon Relief Expedition” occurs, he has
drawn his pen through this and all expressions indicating that the
Expeditionary Force comes to his relief.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

it: it may go back, while I will remain here as Governor-General,
and make the best use I can of the war material which belongs to
me while I hold that position. If I am removed from that

It is important there should be no misconstruction placed on
these words. Had General Gordon thought their death would
benefit the Soudan, he would never have said when he urged their
going down, “If you go, you do me a great service, <i>i.e.</i> do the
Soudan a great service.” When he said, “I dare not, with my
views, say their death is an evil,” he merely meant, “I dare not
say that two brave, just, upright men are not happier in the future
life than in the present one.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

This opinion hardly agrees with that of a military correspondent
of the <i>Times</i>, who, writing from Kartoum, on the 24th
July, 1883, states that to preserve tranquillity at ordinary times,
9,000 troops, exclusive of the garrison of Kartoum, would be
necessary, even supposing the provinces of Kordofan and Darfur
to be abandoned, as has been recommended by several high
authorities. He suggests that the 9,000 troops should be distributed
as follows&mdash;viz., 4,000 between Kartoum and Jebel Ain,
on both sides of the White Nile, 1,000 at Fashoda to keep the
Denka tribes and Shilluks in order, and 4,000 on the Blue Nile,

The information concerning the events of the rebellion up
to the arrival of Lieut.-Colonel Stewart at Kartoum, is derived
almost entirely from native sources, and it is consequently impossible
to put much reliance on the statements as to the extent
of the losses in the various engagements. It is even difficult to
ascertain the correct dates of the principal events. Some accounts
state that the assaults on El Obeyed took place on the
4th, 5th and 6th September.</p>

Two of the battalions were those of the 2nd Regiment,
which had been ordered by Abdel Kader Pasha to operate
against the rebels at Abu-Djuma, but they had done absolutely
nothing. It is not known to what regiments the other battalions
belonged, and whether they had all been sent up from Kartoum,
or if part of the 1st Regiment had been withdrawn from Sennaar.
Owing to the hostility of the Hassanieh Arabs it had been necessary
to reinforce the garrison of Duem by a battalion, and 2000
troops remained in reserve at the camp of Omdurman.</p>

 The troops both marched and fought, formed up in square,
with camels and baggage in the centre, and a few mounted Bashi
Bazouks and men on dromedaries in front to feel the way. In
this formation the army could hardly accomplish eight miles a day,
six being the usual march, and it could, consequently, only strike
a blow when and where the enemy pleased.</p>

Commander Lynedoch Needham Moncrieff entered the
Royal Navy in 1863, and in February 1865, while Sub-Lieutenant
of the <i>Peloros</i>, was engaged in the destruction of piratical
junks in Tungroa Bay. He became Lieutenant in July 1865,
and retired with the rank of Commander in 1873. Proceeding
to the Cape of Good Hope on the outbreak of the Zulu war,
Commander Moncrieff served with the 2nd battalion of the
Native Contingent from May 1879 till the close of the campaign,
during which he was engaged in the battle of Ulundi, where he
was slightly wounded, afterwards having Commissariat charge at
Fort Cambridge. His services were officially commended at the
close of the campaign. In January 1880, the deceased officer
was nominated Consul at Cayenne, and, having passed the examination,
was, on the 4th of March, 1880, appointed Consul for
French Guiana, to reside at Cayenne, but did not proceed
thither, being shortly afterwards sent as acting Consul to Jeddah.
He was appointed Consul at Suakin on the 1st of April, 1882,
the post being worth 750<i>l</i>. per annum, besides an annual allowance
of 250<i>l.</i> for office expenses. Commander Moncrieff received
the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society for saving life at
sea in 1864.</p>
